### Biennale Arts Festival

We give back to the community and engage our students to hone their potential as a leader through our Arts Festival held during non-SYF years; namely we have organised the Arts Festival at Dunman High in 2016, Soul Passion Arts Festival with Punggol West Community in 2018, and Open House x Arts Festival in 2022.
