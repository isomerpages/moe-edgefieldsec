### Sketchnoting@EFSS

Sketchnoting@EFSS was conceptualised and started back in 2017 as we believe that students can be more engaged and take ownership of their learning. Sketchnotes are purposeful doodling as a person actively listens to a lesson or something interesting. Students were introduced to the basic elements of sketchnoting before they were tasked to apply what they had learnt to their first sketchnote.  
  
From a survey conducted after the workshop, students found that sketchnoting can be a way for them to remember what they have learnt for a longer period and it helps them to focus during lessons.

### Digitalisation and Innovation in Music & Art Curriculum   

With the help of PLDs, our Art & Music Curriculum has leveraged ICT tools for our students to learn digital drawing, animation, photography, making and producing music, recording and editing. We also explored innovating our lessons through differentiated instructions, flipped classrooms and effective feedback with the help of technology. Technology also allows our students to share their learning through video presentations and online gallery walks.

The Da Vinci Atelier consists of digital displays used to feature the work of our own students as well as of various artists. Artworks were chosen based on a weekly theme or in support of various school events such as Lunar New Year and Mental Wellness Week. An interactive display, students can scan a QR code under each screen to access information about the artist and engage in an activity.
