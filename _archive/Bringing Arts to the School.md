### AISS (Artists-In-School-Scheme) 

In the second year of the AISS, interested students participated in 5 sessions with artist Marvin Tang to learn more deeply about storytelling through photography. Students then immersed themselves in a photography project at Coney Island to take their own series of photographs with the theme '**PUNGGOL: Our Narrative Through Lenses**'.

### Manga Art E-Assembly Programme 

Even with Covid-19 restrictions, we leveraged on ICT tools to ensure that E-Assembly programmes are still interactive and interesting for our students. During one such programme, all students learnt to create a manga portrait. Students then uploaded and shared their works online for a school-wide gallery walk at the end.
