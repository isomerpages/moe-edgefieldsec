**Description** <br>
National Civil Defence Corps (NCDCC) is a recognised member of the National Uniformed Group. Students will acquire important life-saving skills such as CPR and AED, and be empowered to be active and concerned citizens advocating life-saving skills. Through close partnership with the SCDF, students will have opportunities to visit Civil Defence Academy, Home Team Academy and fire stations.&nbsp;

NCDCC also provides a platform for students to develop leadership, communication, relationship management and social awareness skills.

We hope to nurture and develop our cadets into resilient and responsible citizens through innovative and challenging CD activities.

We adopt a structured approach towards the development of programmes that will equip cadets with the 21st CC via alignment with 3 Big CCE ideas:

(1) Identity - Formation of key identity as a NCDCC cadet through the learning of essential skill sets &amp; competencies;&nbsp;<br>
(2) Relationship - Forming of effective relationships with peers and community through leading; and&nbsp;<br>
(3) Choices - Making the choice to care, serve and impact.
