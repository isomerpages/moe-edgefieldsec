**Description** <br>
NPCC SEA hopes to develop its Cadets into Caring and Responsible Citizens and mould the Builders of a Safe &amp; Secure home.

Through the CCA, we hope to to ensure students’ growth by exposing them to a challenging environment, which, in turn will imbibe them with leadership qualities, strong character and civic, social and moral values.

We hope to enlighten students on the role of the Singapore Police Force and the Police Coast Guard, helping to build a stronger bond of friendship with them, and so lead to a safer place for all in the country.&nbsp;

We also wish to build a culture where students will learn to treat fellow cadets with respect, courtesy and tact, teaching them to extend the same care and concern to others; and through its identification with the Singapore Police Force and Police Coast Guard, teach students to adopt their tradition of high standards of performance, commitment, duty and service, to seek to excel and to face challenges.
