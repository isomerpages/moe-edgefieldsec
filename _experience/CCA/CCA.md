I have learnt the importance of having discipline and compassionate leadership in Girl Guides.
    
Discipline plays a great role in forging a role model for the younger ones to follow along. Having discipline in Guiding is crucial as it allows me to practice self-consciousness in all that I do.
    
As a Company Leader, I am forced to see things from a wider perspective and overcome challenges while still showing compassion towards my juniors. This allows me to respond to situations better and helps me understand my juniors better as well.

My CCA has played a significant part in improving my leadership abilities. I initially didn't want a leadership role due to the huge responsibilities I would have to bear, but this opportunity has helped to improve my communication skills and my confidence in speaking to a large group. I've learnt that responsibility and teamwork are crucial to being a leader during my time in the CCA. Everyone needs to play a part to ensure things go smoothly, and with the help of my other CCA mates, I am able to cope with the tasks placed onto me. 
    
I enjoy the campcraft sessions while the drill sessions, are more fast-paced. The campcraft sessions also allow me to work with my other CCA mates. The leadership skills that I have learnt can be useful in both a school setting and a workplace environment, where I would have to work together with others.

I believe that my CCA helped me improve my confidence. I was a person who didn't consider myself as a leader. Having the opportunity to be a leader in my CCA has helped me improve in areas that I was weak in, such as addressing large groups.  
  
I have learnt that teamwork is quite an important quality. I am thankful for the support and co-operation of my teammate that have helped me cope with the responsibilities that were given to me. These skills and values that I have improved on have helped me to change the way I tackle a challenge or problem, and this has changed my personality in a good way. The soft skills that I have learnt and the basic fire safety knowledge that I have gained from the CCA will not be forgotten. I am also thankful for my teachers guiding us in our CCA.

My experience in Scouts has been a fun and memorable one. Over the past few years, I’ve not only learnt values such as leadership and teamwork but also forged many memories through camps and exchange programmes. 
    
One memorable incident which I enjoyed the most was during the annual Cub Scout Leadership Camp that we organised in 2019. Through this experience, we had the opportunity to plan and lead a camp for over 200 Primary School Cub Scouts. We had to overcome many challenges and step out of our comfort zone to make decisions and communicate effectively with others.  
  
During my time in Scouts, I’ve seen our troop grow and excel. Our patrols have become more bonded through various scouting activities as well as our annual Job Week Camp in March.

Each sport is more than a sport - it is an activity that teaches us the many important values of life. Badminton is one of them. Badminton not only teaches us skills in the sport but it helps us grow as a person. As for me, I have learnt the importance of integrity, self discipline, respect and more. By taking training seriously, respecting coaches and teammates, this CCA has benefited me a lot and I would not have become who I am now without it. I believe that both studies and CCA are equally as important. Thus, I have to manage my time there are challenges in managing both the physical training and school workload.  
  
My father has always told me ‘Take one step at a time, there is no rush.’ This is the one thing that has helped me push through my tough times and come out victorious. I have learnt that with enough determination and patience, you will find your light at the end of the tunnel.

Basketball is a sport that requires not only physical presence but also mental tenacity in a player. After being in Edgefield Basketball for 3 years, I have grown to realise that Basketball is not just a game but a reflection of life on the hardwood court.  
  
Here in Edgefield Basketball, the teachers and coach work closely with all of us to ensure that we meet and achieve the different objectives set out for us. We learn about teamwork, communication, decision making, respect, self-discipline and tenacity.  
  
Being a Captain, I have learnt the value of responsibility and leadership. Through my teachers’ and coach’s advice, I have learnt to deal with difficult situations especially during competitions and have also learnt to manage my team’s motivation and attitude during training. I have learnt that I need to have a very good grasp of my time as it is divided between my academics and training.  
  
For the Girl’s Team, we beat many odds to reach the Top 4 in the Inter-Schools South Zone Basketball Tournament in 2019. While it was a pity this year’s competition was disrupted due to the pandemic, we have learnt not to give up and be adaptable. Instead, we have been focusing on training for next year’s competition where we know we can get back stronger, fitter and more prepared than ever.  
  
Being a part of the Edgefield Basketball team has allowed all of us to gain different life experiences that we can confidently bring forward to any aspect of our lives. People call basketball a sport but to all of us at Edgefield Basketball Team, it is our passion.

I have learnt a lot during these 3 years in this CCA. I believe the biggest take away for from this CCA is learning that being a leader is not just about talking, giving commands or leading the team. It is more about being able to listen and understand the needs of my juniors, to empathize with them and work with them to make the CCA more fun and enjoyable.  
  
These 3 years have been really fun and meaningful. I am really thankful for teachers who help us along the way and am also really grateful for my teammates’ support. Being in this CCA has taught me a lot not just about the sport itself but about my morals and beliefs. Without a doubt, I will continue to give my best in this CCA.

Softball CCA has taught me many values which can be applied in my life. In this CCA, I have learnt to be more resilient and also to persevere no matter what. Physical training can be tiring as we need to do a lot of strength and stamina training. There are times where I did have thoughts of giving up, however, keeping in mind that I am a Captain, I have to persevere not only for my teammates but for myself as well to set an example for the team. Not only that, I have also learnt the importance of teamwork. Softball is a sport which requires 9 people on the field to play well and get the opposite team's runners out. If we do not have teamwork, it would be hard to accomplish anything. These values are really important and could be used in many areas of life. I am really thankful that the CCA has taught me so many great values that can be inculcated in my life.  
  
Training is fun with my juniors, seniors, coaches and teachers-in-charge. They make CCA much more fun and enjoyable for me. I am really grateful for all of them. Though some training sessions might be tough, I still have fun. Moreover, not only do learn many values through the CCA, I have also learnt to be a better leader. I remember when I was still a junior in Secondary 1, I was really quiet and I didn't really speak up much. After I was given the opportunity to become the captain, I realised if I didn’t speak up and be the voice that leads the team, I would be letting my team down. This made me step out of my comfort zone and helped me grow as a person. Although being a CCA leader is not easy, I'm glad I got the opportunity to lead and serve as it has helped me grow as a person. With that, I will continue to strive and do my best for the CCA.

I enjoy being in Taekwondo as I am able to grow in multiple ways such as developing my leadership skills, learning values that help me along the way as I grow older, and developing a sense of camaraderie among my teammates. We learn to look out for one another, celebrate our successes and even work through failures together.  
  
Being in this CCA has taught me that time management and prioritisation is very important as I have to manage both my CCA and studies. I have also learnt many new skills that are essential for me in performing well during competitions, and have gained more knowledge in self-defense.  
  
My aspirations are to win more medals and perform well in competitions and make a huge contribution to the CCA. I want to inspire my juniors to do better. I hope that everyone will be able to achieve what their goals in this CCA, whether it’s their first time being a part of Taekwondo or if they are experienced. I hope that we will work together towards many great achievements in the near future!

Volleyball CCA has helped me improve on my basics in the sport. For example, as a libero, I have to improve my digging skills to receive and defend against opponent attacks. However, as a whole, I have learnt how to play volleyball competitively, ranging from improving my skills to knowing the rules well. This is something I would not have never expected to learn when I joined the CCA in Secondary 1.  
  
After joining the CCA, I have learned and adopted two main values, discipline and teamwork. In order to learn and progress efficiently as a player, we must have the discipline to follow instructions given by the coach. For example, we need to build our basics well before we can play a game proper. However, discipline does not stop there. In respecting others in our CCA, teamwork is also important in creating a conducive environment for training.  
  
I enjoy the CCA as I am able to interact with my teammates after a long day of lessons. This helps to create tighter bonds with one another which can transfer into better team spirit and camaraderie in competitions. The CCA also helps us to keep fit as we train.  
  
After graduating from Edgefield, I might consider joining a volleyball team in the tertiary institute or a club outside the school scene. Recreationally, I have a skill that can help me in making new friends through sharing the sharing of common interest. I can also apply the value of teamwork, and working together with someone I may not like. We would have to work together to reach a common goal. This can definitely be applied to the working world in future.

What I enjoy about being part of the Wushu team is performing all sorts of different moves and routines. When I get to perform different moves during every training session and when I manage to succeed in performing those moves, I feel a sense of fulfilment. I have learnt to be resilient, disciplined and have learnt how difficulties can be overcome by putting in 100% effort.  
  
One of the challenges I face during CCA is that there are moves in Wushu that are personally difficult for me to achieve. One such example is performing the split. While doing the split can be difficult, I make sure to put in 100% effort to work on it at every single training and I would try my best to preserve to achieve my splits and today, I have managed to achieve it.  
  
Wushu has also taught me how to be a better student. The values I’ve learnt have benefited me when it comes to my studies. I do not easily give up when I face difficulties in learning and it has also taught me that putting in my best effort in my work will allow me to achieve the result I want.  
  
I have also become a better leader. As training and performing the sport requires discipline, over time, I have become more self-disciplined, have better decision-making skills and am a better role model. I make sure that my juniors listen to what the coach is teaching attentively and that they do not play around too much during training.  
  
Overall Wushu has really helped me in many aspects of my life and it has taught me to be a better person in the face of many challenges.
