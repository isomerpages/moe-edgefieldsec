Joining the Art Club CCA has helped me in refining my drawing, brainstorming, and cooperation skills. By contributing to events such as the school's ARTasFEST or Teacher's Day, the CCA members are given opportunities to design things like logos and cards. In addition, we participate in competitions like the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). These activities have become learning experiences for me as I broadened my abilities and worked on improving my skills.  
      
As a member of the Art Club, looking out for one another, striving to do better, and completing work are some of my topmost priorities. This inculcates the values of compassion, resilience and responsibility in me, and lets me mature as a young adult.  
      
Coming to CCA every week has made me find joy in work and feel more passionate about art. Some of the many things I enjoy would be our visits to exhibits, meeting Art Club students from other schools, and supporting various communities through art.  
      
I hope to pursue a career in visual communications, which requires experience in various areas in art. I believe that with the skills and knowledge I have gained from my CCA, I will be able to continue my journey with the arts in different ways.
