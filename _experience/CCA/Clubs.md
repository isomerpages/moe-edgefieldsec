"Ever since I joined Art Club CCA, there has never been any session where I stopped gaining new skills. Art Club has helped me expand my creativity to a higher level and has also led me to think out of the box, coming up with new ideas. My CCA members and I are given numerous opportunities to build our painting, drawing and thinking skills. School events such as card designing, poster design competitions, mural designing, Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and ARTasFEST, have enabled my CCA members and I to widen and build our creativity as well as idea-generating skills.

As the President of the Art Club, it is my duty and utmost priority to help my CCA members accomplish their goals of improving their skills and make everyone feel involved. By doing so, members would take pride in what they do and demonstrate values of resilience, responsibility and kindness, which will shape them into kind and responsible young adults.

Being in the Art Club has made me realise that I have a strong passion for art. Some things that I truly enjoy are the visits to workshops and gallery walks around Singapore. It enables me to learn about different types of art and its beautiful forms. Art Club has made me appreciate art at a much deeper level.I hope to be as passionate as I am now about art in the future and be able to bring my passion to greater heights."

"As an active member of the Entrepreneur Club (E-Club) CCA, my experience has been profoundly transformative.&nbsp;

E-Club has taught me the essence of entrepreneurship, leadership, and collaboration, fostering a resilient entrepreneurial mindset. These skills have not only enriched my personal ventures but have also contributed to a culture of creativity within the E- club. I've also come to understand the power of effective teamwork, communication, and problem-solving through my interactions with fellow members. E-Club has been instrumental in showcasing the impact of mentorship and support in nurturing our entrepreneurial goals, empowering us to drive innovation and ambition within our school community."

New Media Club enables us to learn both technical and soft skills required in Audio Visual management. Learning the ins and outs of managing an event requires us to be proficient in operating the various equipment and in communicating well with each other. The CCA also gives us plenty of opportunities to partake in school events to ensure that the event runs smoothly.  
  
Not only that, we can hone our photography and videography skills through our participation in competitions each year. We are encouraged to use our creativity to come up with interesting photos and videos that fit the theme of the competition. We also learn to work together in team competitions.  
  
The CCA also takes us to places such as Gardens by The Bay where we took photos of the plants and enjoyed friendly competitions with each other. Such experiences give us all a chance to bond together and get to know one another better.  
  
The photography and videography technical skills as well as the AV management skills would come in handy when we choose related courses in our Post-secondary journey. One key skill that we have picked up in this CCA is that of leadership and teamwork. By managing and leading school events, we can be prepared to take on a leadership role in the future and learn to work under pressure. Working with each other allows us to learn to work with others and will definitely be useful when we are in a team-based workspace.

I have always loved aeroplanes and everything about aviation. When I was younger, I was always either googling or reading articles to better my knowledge on planes. Placing SYFC as my first choice for my CCA was definitely a no-brainer.
        
During the CCA interview in Year 1, I expressed about my love for all things aviation. I was elated when I found out that my application to join SYFC was approved. This is where the passion really started to become a reality as I was able to learn hands-on about building model airplanes.  
          
In Year Two, I requested to join the SYFC Special Interest Group (SIG) to learn more advanced aeromodelling skills. This was when I&nbsp;learnt&nbsp;to build and fly even more complex model airplanes. With the extra set of skills that I picked up from SIG, I began to have more confidence in my abilities as an aeromodeller. After having spent so much time researching on the best airplane designs, it was very satisfying to see my completed model airplanes fly well for competitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        
Being a CCA leader made me&nbsp;realise&nbsp;that apart from leading my peers in weekly sessions, I also need to exemplify the crucial qualities of determination and staying focused. It has certainly been a roller coaster ride but I will constantly look for ways to improve myself so that I can be a better leader.&nbsp;

Being in Robotics, I have improved in my coding skills, especially in python. Our CCA has exposed me to different kinds of coding languages and provided coding courses that have helped me understand how coding works and the various ways I can apply these skills to real-world situations.  
When I was in primary school, I had no experience in leadership and was not very sociable. However, after joining Robotics, my teachers and friends have created opportunities to help me grow and develop leadership and strengthen my social relationship. This is where I get to interact with my friends and hone my communication skills.  
  
One thing I really enjoy being in Robotics is the trust from my teachers in learning through experimenting. We are able to express ourselves freely and learn from any challenges we face together in a team. The friendly environment in Robotics helps all of us to support each other and it is almost like my second family. The friendship I have with my friends and teachers makes my journey in Robotics memorable.  
  
The skills and values inculcated to me have made me more interested in the world of technology, and I would be interested in pursuing a closely related career. Robotics has certainly taught me to have a growth mindset and that anything is possible. I will always carry this belief in me no matter what I do.
