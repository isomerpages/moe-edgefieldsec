Joining the Art Club CCA has helped me in refining my drawing, brainstorming, and cooperation skills. By contributing to events such as the school's ARTasFEST or Teacher's Day, the CCA members are given opportunities to design things like logos and cards. In addition, we participate in competitions like the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). These activities have become learning experiences for me as I broadened my abilities and worked on improving my skills.  
      
As a member of the Art Club, looking out for one another, striving to do better, and completing work are some of my topmost priorities. This inculcates the values of compassion, resilience and responsibility in me, and lets me mature as a young adult.  
      
Coming to CCA every week has made me find joy in work and feel more passionate about art. Some of the many things I enjoy would be our visits to exhibits, meeting Art Club students from other schools, and supporting various communities through art.  
      
I hope to pursue a career in visual communications, which requires experience in various areas in art. I believe that with the skills and knowledge I have gained from my CCA, I will be able to continue my journey with the arts in different ways.

Ever since I joined the Entrepreneurship Club (E-Club), there has not been a day when I stopped learning. My CCA members and I participate in various competitions to learn about entrepreneurship. We learn how to pitch our ideas in front of an audience, work with people and apply business marketing skills in specific scenarios.  
  
In this CCA, we learn many different values like perseverance towards our main goal, having a vision to guide us and exercising bravery in pursuing opportunities. There are many things that I enjoy in this journey, but my favourite is definitely interacting with my fellow CCA members as we venture into learning new areas. All that I have learnt would benefit my future whether in society, at home and at work. Being in this CCA has taught me how to better communicate with the people around me. It has also broadened my creativity for creating new solutions to problems occurring in the world we live in.  
  
I'd certainly want to join a course similar to E-Club in the future and would love to see myself as a young entrepreneur!

New Media Club enables us to learn both technical and soft skills required in Audio Visual management. Learning the ins and outs of managing an event requires us to be proficient in operating the various equipment and in communicating well with each other. The CCA also gives us plenty of opportunities to partake in school events to ensure that the event runs smoothly.  
  
Not only that, we can hone our photography and videography skills through our participation in competitions each year. We are encouraged to use our creativity to come up with interesting photos and videos that fit the theme of the competition. We also learn to work together in team competitions.  
  
The CCA also takes us to places such as Gardens by The Bay where we took photos of the plants and enjoyed friendly competitions with each other. Such experiences give us all a chance to bond together and get to know one another better.  
  
The photography and videography technical skills as well as the AV management skills would come in handy when we choose related courses in our Post-secondary journey. One key skill that we have picked up in this CCA is that of leadership and teamwork. By managing and leading school events, we can be prepared to take on a leadership role in the future and learn to work under pressure. Working with each other allows us to learn to work with others and will definitely be useful when we are in a team-based workspace.

In the Thinkers’ Society, I enjoy working with people, despite sometimes having differing personalities and viewpoints, we strive to complete a common goal together. This allows me to expand my thinking and be more open-minded.  
  
I have also developed values such as commitment and leadership. Despite a busy schedule across the year, I have learnt how to stay committed to both my CCA and studies to ensure that I strike a good balance between the two. As President of the CCA, I have learnt how to motivate my members to give their best especially when they feel discouraged from setbacks.  
  
I have become more adaptable when faced with new situations because I was spurred to step out of my comfort zone on many occasions. Such skills and values will greatly benefit me when I encounter obstacles in my future education and workplace.

I have always loved aeroplanes and everything about aviation. When I was younger, I was always either googling or reading articles to better my knowledge on planes. Placing SYFC as my first choice for my CCA was definitely a no-brainer.
        
During the CCA interview in Year 1, I expressed about my love for all things aviation. I was elated when I found out that my application to join SYFC was approved. This is where the passion really started to become a reality as I was able to learn hands-on about building model airplanes.  
          
In Year Two, I requested to join the SYFC Special Interest Group (SIG) to learn more advanced aeromodelling skills. This was when I learnt to build and fly even more complex model airplanes. With the extra set of skills that I picked up from SIG, I began to have more confidence in my abilities as an aeromodeller. After having spent so much time researching on the best airplane designs, it was very satisfying to see my completed model airplanes fly well for competitions.  
        
Being a CCA leader made me realise that apart from leading my peers in weekly sessions, I also need to exemplify the crucial qualities of determination and staying focused. It has certainly been a roller coaster ride but I will constantly look for ways to improve myself so that I can be a better leader.

Being in Robotics, I have improved in my coding skills, especially in python. Our CCA has exposed me to different kinds of coding languages and provided coding courses that have helped me understand how coding works and the various ways I can apply these skills to real-world situations.  
When I was in primary school, I had no experience in leadership and was not very sociable. However, after joining Robotics, my teachers and friends have created opportunities to help me grow and develop leadership and strengthen my social relationship. This is where I get to interact with my friends and hone my communication skills.  
  
One thing I really enjoy being in Robotics is the trust from my teachers in learning through experimenting. We are able to express ourselves freely and learn from any challenges we face together in a team. The friendly environment in Robotics helps all of us to support each other and it is almost like my second family. The friendship I have with my friends and teachers makes my journey in Robotics memorable.  
  
The skills and values inculcated to me have made me more interested in the world of technology, and I would be interested in pursuing a closely related career. Robotics has certainly taught me to have a growth mindset and that anything is possible. I will always carry this belief in me no matter what I do.
