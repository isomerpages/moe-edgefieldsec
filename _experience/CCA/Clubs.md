Being part of the Art Club CCA has been a truly enriching experience. It has allowed me to explore various art forms and expand my creative skills. Through experimenting with different techniques and mediums, I have developed a deeper appreciation for art. The supportive environment within the club has encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and push my artistic boundaries. Additionally, the collaboration with fellow members has fostered a sense of community and shared passion. Taking on leadership roles within the club has also helped me grow in confidence and taught me the importance of guiding others while working towards a common goal. Overall, the Art Club has not only nurtured my artistic growth but has also given me a platform to express myself freely. I look forward to continuing my artistic journey with the club.

"As an active member of the Entrepreneur Club (E-Club) CCA, my experience has been profoundly transformative.&nbsp;

E-Club has taught me the essence of entrepreneurship, leadership, and collaboration, fostering a resilient entrepreneurial mindset. These skills have not only enriched my personal ventures but have also contributed to a culture of creativity within the E- club. I've also come to understand the power of effective teamwork, communication, and problem-solving through my interactions with fellow members. E-Club has been instrumental in showcasing the impact of mentorship and support in nurturing our entrepreneurial goals, empowering us to drive innovation and ambition within our school community."

<h5>New Media Club</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/clubs/new-media-club).
    
New Media Club enables us to learn both technical and soft skills required in Audio Visual management. Learning the ins and outs of managing an event requires us to be proficient in operating the various equipment and in communicating well with each other. The CCA also gives us plenty of opportunities to partake in school events to ensure that the event runs smoothly.  
  
Not only that, we can hone our photography and videography skills through our participation in competitions each year. We are encouraged to use our creativity to come up with interesting photos and videos that fit the theme of the competition. We also learn to work together in team competitions.  
  
The CCA also takes us to places such as Gardens by The Bay where we took photos of the plants and enjoyed friendly competitions with each other. Such experiences give us all a chance to bond together and get to know one another better.  
  
The photography and videography technical skills as well as the AV management skills would come in handy when we choose related courses in our Post-secondary journey. One key skill that we have picked up in this CCA is that of leadership and teamwork. By managing and leading school events, we can be prepared to take on a leadership role in the future and learn to work under pressure. Working with each other allows us to learn to work with others and will definitely be useful when we are in a team-based workspace.

<h5>Singapore Youth Flying Club</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/clubs/syfc).
        
Over the course of my school life in SYFC, I have been given the opportunity to interact with students who share my passion for aviation. CCA sessions include building our knowledge in aviation, hands-on activities to train our skills in building gliders, and also flying drones. Another activity I love doing in my CCA would also be learning new flight simulator skills and also flying via a circuit pattern in the flight simulator application that we use each CCA session. I also appreciate being able to learn more about aerodynamics. Participating in the annual Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition enabled me to apply flight theory in designing gliders.

The provision of opportunities to work with my peers and learn more about aeromodelling from them makes me enjoy being part of the CCA.

Being a CCA leader gives me opportunities to lead and share my knowledge and skills with my CCA mates. It has also cultivated a sense of perseverance and responsibility as a student leader. Even though there have been many ups and downs in my leadership journey, I would always reflect and take these opportunities for me to grow as a leader, and streng then the CCA.

<h5>Robotics Club</h5>
		
For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/clubs/robotics-club).

In Robotics, there are no set instructions. There is no right or wrong method in programming and building robots. The endless possibilities I faced had been daunting to consider for my Sec 1 self. I often found myself asking, "Where should I put the brain of the robot? Which mechanism should I use to complete this task?". Even today, these questions linger. No method is set in stone and finding the most efficient approach requires trial and error. This uncertainty, more often than not, left me wishing there was a handbook to guide me through various tasks. <br><br>
However, as much as it frustrates me, these experiences have helped me develop many skills, such as perseverance, critical thinking, and adaptability. The time I have spent in CCA has been incredibly enriching; I have learnt a lot from both my seniors and juniors. My seniors provided invaluable support and laid the foundation of knowledge I rely on today, while my juniors allowed me to hone my leadership skills and offered a fresh perspective on problems. Being in Robotics has provided me numerous opportunities, from day-to-day trainings to competitions, and it has played a significant role in shaping my identity.<br><br>

My journey in the Robotics Club has been an enlightening one. It has exposed me to a diverse range of skills and knowledge to an extent that I had never experienced beforehand. Through coding and robot design, I have learnt the essence of both teamwork and the beauty of friendship. In challenging times, I had received enormous support from both teachers and friends, pushing me to cross the boundaries of my thinking and refining my problem-solving skills in every challenge I faced. <br><br>
From a young age, I had very limited experience to exercise my leadership and independent thinking skills since opportunities were few and far between. However, the open and inclusive environment in the Robotics Club has provided me with the perfect platform to hone these qualities, allowing me to forge strong relationships with both teachers and members.
<br><br>
Robotics as a discipline is truly enjoyable as it creates a sense of freedom and supports experimentation. Learning through trial and error, I have received much support every step of the way in my learning process. Even when faced with failure, I have learnt that it is just a stepping stone to success.
<br><br>
Above all, the Robotics Club has taught me the qualities of being a caring person. We always support each other when in need and the club is like my second family. Reflecting on my journey here, I appreciate the unique blend of education and bonding it offers the most. Over the years, I have gained greater interest in the field of robotics and I look forward to pursuing a career in a related field. I am committed to upholding the values of compassion and respect I have learnt in the CCA and I will continue to share with others my experiences in this extraordinary community as my journey continues.
