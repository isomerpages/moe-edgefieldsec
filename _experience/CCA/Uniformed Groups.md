I have learnt the importance of having discipline and compassionate leadership in Girl Guides.
    
Discipline plays a great role in forging a role model for the younger ones to follow along. Having discipline in Guiding is crucial as it allows me to practice self-consciousness in all that I do.
    
As a Company Leader, I am forced to see things from a wider perspective and overcome challenges while still showing compassion towards my juniors. This allows me to respond to situations better and helps me understand my juniors better as well.

My CCA has played a significant part in improving my leadership abilities. I initially didn't want a leadership role due to the huge responsibilities I would have to bear, but this opportunity has helped to improve my communication skills and my confidence in speaking to a large group. I've learnt that responsibility and teamwork are crucial to being a leader during my time in the CCA. Everyone needs to play a part to ensure things go smoothly, and with the help of my other CCA mates, I am able to cope with the tasks placed onto me. 
    
I enjoy the campcraft sessions while the drill sessions, are more fast-paced. The campcraft sessions also allow me to work with my other CCA mates. The leadership skills that I have learnt can be useful in both a school setting and a workplace environment, where I would have to work together with others.

Through NCDCC, I have honed my leadership skills. I have had multiple opportunities to plan and execute various activities such as training, sports, lessons and parades. NCDCC has also given me the confidence to give commands to my unit so that we can all work together to achieve training objectives.  
  
Being in NCDCC has taught me to become more disciplined. It is reflected in something as simple as keeping still in parades. Not only has it helped me as a student, I also believe that discipline is crucial in an emergency as one needs to have the discipline to follow the commands of the leader to ensure the rescue is efficiently carried out.   
  
The first aid skills picked up during training could potentially save someone's life. It is important to attend CCA trainings regularly, to refresh what we have learnt. Though training may be tough at times, with discipline, I believe that the unit will overcome challenges together.

My experience in Scouts has been a fun and memorable one. Over the past few years, I’ve not only learnt values such as leadership and teamwork but also forged many memories through camps and exchange programmes. 
    
One memorable incident which I enjoyed the most was during the annual Cub Scout Leadership Camp that we organised in 2019. Through this experience, we had the opportunity to plan and lead a camp for over 200 Primary School Cub Scouts. We had to overcome many challenges and step out of our comfort zone to make decisions and communicate effectively with others.  
  
During my time in Scouts, I’ve seen our troop grow and excel. Our patrols have become more bonded through various scouting activities as well as our annual Job Week Camp in March.
