<h5>Girl Guides</h5>

I have learnt the importance of having discipline and compassionate leadership in Girl Guides.
    
Discipline plays a great role in forging a role model for the younger ones to follow along. Having discipline in Guiding is crucial as it allows me to practice self-consciousness in all that I do.
    
As a Company Leader, I am forced to see things from a wider perspective and overcome challenges while still showing compassion towards my juniors. This allows me to respond to situations better and helps me understand my juniors better as well.

<h5>NPCC (Sea)</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/uniformed-groups/npcc-sea).

NPCC has significantly enhanced my problem-solving skills by exposing me to real-world challenges, such as adapting to sudden plan changes and addressing emergencies, allowing me to quickly find effective solutions and maintain a positive mindset.

Through NPCC, I have learned the values of discipline, leadership, and service to the community. What I enjoy most is the camaraderie and the sense of accomplishment that comes from working together to overcome challenges and achieve our goals.

The skills and values I've gained from NPCC, such as effective time management, adaptability, and a strong sense of discipline, will be invaluable in my future endeavors, helping me to navigate challenges, prioritize tasks, and stay committed to my goals.

<h5>NCDCC</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/uniformed-groups/ncdcc).
    
As an NCDCC leader, I have witnessed firsthand the profound impact this CCA has on our cadets. Through rigorous training in first aid, fire safety, and emergency response, our members gain invaluable practical skills that are crucial in real-world situations. 
  
The values we instill—Noble, Caring, Disciplined, Courageous, Commited—are foundational for their personal growth. The cadets take pride in their ability to help others, fostering a strong sense of community spirit. They also enjoy the camaraderie and the hands-on nature of our activities, such as learning the CPR and useful first aid skills, which keep them engaged and motivated.
  
These experiences not only prepare them for potential careers in healthcare or emergency services but also ensure they are well-rounded individuals ready to face future challenges with confidence and compassion.

<h5>Scouts</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/uniformed-groups/scouts).
    
My experience in Scouts has been a fun and memorable one. Over the past few years, I’ve not only learnt values such as leadership and teamwork but also forged many memories through camps and exchange programmes.&nbsp;
    
One memorable incident which I enjoyed the most was during the annual Cub Scout Leadership Camp that we organised in 2019. Through this experience, we had the opportunity to plan and lead a camp for over 200 Primary School Cub Scouts. We had to overcome many challenges and step out of our comfort zone to make decisions and communicate effectively with others.  
  
During my time in Scouts, I’ve seen our troop grow and excel. Our patrols have become more bonded through various scouting activities as well as our annual Job Week Camp in March.
