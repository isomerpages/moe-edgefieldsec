“I enjoy being in a sports CCA because it allows me to learn many important values which we can apply in the future. Everyone in the Badminton Team has a common interest thus we connect well and create a friendly and conducive environment for our training. Furthermore, going through hardships with each other helps form a sense of camaraderie. We would look out for each other, have fun together, and develop our badminton skills together. Finally, during the annual National School Games (NSG), our skills and nerves are put to the test, as we represent Edgefield to compete with many other schools, under pressure and facing different opponents. We need to learn how to keep a cool head in order to play out our best. During the NSG, our team encouraged each other to persevere, and we ultimately clinched 3rd place in the North Zone. This was a reflection of our commitment, perseverance and unity as a team!”

Basketball has been a pivotal part of my life since I first played in primary school. Joining the school team as captain of the girls’ basketball team in secondary school was a significant step for me. It provided a platform to develop my skills, build friendships, and learn valuable life lessons.

Practices were intense and often challenging, instilling discipline and perseverance in all of us, thanks to the support of my coach, teachers, and seniors. As captain, I focused not only on improving my own game but also on encouraging my teammates. Through countless drills and scrimmages, I honed my shooting, passing, and defensive strategies, gaining confidence with each session.

One of the most memorable moments was our championship game in the 2023 C Division. The atmosphere was electric, with our seniors and the boys' basketball team cheering us on. Despite the pressure, I felt a deep sense of unity with my teammates, each of us focused on a common goal. The exhilaration of that game remains one of my proudest achievements. Even though we lost, making it to the finals demonstrated that our efforts paid off, but we still had room for improvement.

Beyond the physical aspects of the game, basketball taught me about resilience. We faced many losses, but each defeat was an opportunity to learn and grow. The camaraderie I built with my teammates transformed into lasting friendships, creating a support system that extended beyond the court.

My basketball experience in secondary school has shaped who I am today. It has taught me about leadership, teamwork, perseverance, and the joy of pursuing a passion. I am grateful for the memories and lessons learned, which I will carry with me long after my school days.

<h5>Softball</h5>

Softball is definitely a tough sport. As the captain of the team, I’ve learned that training under the hot sun can be challenging, testing our physical and mental limits. The game has many rules, and it takes time to get the hang of them, but once you do, it’s incredibly fun.

My teammates play a crucial role in this journey. Their support and camaraderie create an environment where we can push each other to improve. We celebrate our victories together and learn from our losses, fostering a strong team spirit.

Throughout this experience, I’ve gained valuable life lessons. I’ve learned the importance of teamwork, discipline, and determination. There were times when I felt like giving up, but as the Captain of the CCA, I realised I needed to push through—not just for myself, but to set a positive example for my teammates.

Being part of this team has not only enhanced my softball skills but also taught me about leadership and the value of hard work. I am proud to lead such an incredible group, and I look forward to what we can achieve together!

<h5>Volleyball</h5>

**For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/sports/volleyball-boys).**

Volleyball is the single best sport for fostering holistic development, covering every dimension, from the physical aspects of explosive power, stamina, and reaction time, to the mental qualities of mindset, work ethic, and values.&nbsp;

My journey as part of Edgefield Secondary School's volleyball team has been instrumental in shaping who I am today. There are lessons that simply cannot be taught by pen and paper. Instead, these lessons have become ingrained in me through the invaluable experiences I've been through in this CCA.

Volleyball has taught me that setbacks and losses are not failures, but stepping stones on the path to success. I’ve learned to stay focused, bounce back from mistakes, and maintain a positive attitude, even in the face of adversity. Through this sport, I’ve adopted unwavering self-discipline, which has extended beyond the court to my personal and academic life. Juggling both volleyball and my studies has demanded solid time management and high stress tolerance from me, which I am utterly grateful for.

What stands out to me is the strength of teamwork. Volleyball has shown me that for a team to succeed, every member must contribute their best. This understanding has brought my teammates and me closer together. We uplift each other by encouraging one another to remain steadfast and determined both on and off the court, creating a positive cycle of growth and achievement.

If you’re looking for a CCA that pushes your limits and fosters growth in every aspect of your life, come join us. Feel the energy as “EDGEFIELD! ACE! ACE! ACE!!” echoes throughout the school every Monday and Thursday!

<h5>Wushu</h5>
		
**For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/sports/wushu).**
    
Wushu teaches me important life skills that would really benefit me in the future. One of those skills is the ability to concentrate fully on the current thing that I'm doing. When learning a move or routine, I'll need to put all my attention to it so as to learn and remember the details of the moves and routines. Over the course of the CCA trainings every week, I am able to make it a habit to focus on the thing I'm doing, this helps me to deal with external distractions better. Wushu also inspires our imagination as we will have to choreograph the wushu performances that are put up during festivals. The need to think and combine different basic moves smoothly really improves our creativity.

One value that I've learnt from wushu is patience. Improvement in your skills takes time and your skills wouldn't improve drastically overnight. Therefore, I need to be patient and continuously put in 100% effort in each session to make progress and continually improve. Moreover, Wushu has also taught me to be resilient and disciplined, so that I do not lose my courage in the face of difficulties and failures. These values ensure that when I face challenges in my academic studies (not being able to do well in certain subjects) or in my daily life, I do not give up easily and persevere. Beacuse of Wushu, I am able to have more patience towards my family and peers, thus I am able to remain calm when others are getting impatient, bringing less conflict between me and others. 

Concentration is needed every time we carry out a task and with the skill to concentrate and focus well, we will be able to efficiently complete our task, in school or in the workforce. This allows us to perform better in the future. Moreover, the patience developed during the training will allow us to remain calm and collected even when we are unable to accomplish our goals right away. This then helps us to be more efficient since we do not leave difficult tasks aside. Lastly, we will be experiencing many challenges and setbacks in our life but with the development of resilience in Wushu, we will have the determination to strive through the difficult times and not be stopped by the challenges, continuing to work hard towards our goal.
