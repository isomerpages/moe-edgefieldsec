<h5>Choir</h5>

Being part of the choir has been an incredibly rewarding journey. Participating in competitions taught me the level of dedication and hard work required to excel, while performing at a hospital for the elderly was a particularly memorable experience. It was fulfilling to connect with and uplift others through our music. Serving as choir president also came with responsibilities that significantly contributed to my personal growth. Leading warm-ups and delivering debriefs helped me develop my public speaking skills, and managing the group during rehearsals, like ensuring everyone stayed focused, strengthened my leadership and organizational abilities. Though initially daunting, these tasks ultimately boosted my confidence in addressing large groups and keeping the team on track.

The teamwork and camaraderie within the choir were equally important. Bonding through fun games during trainings helped us build strong relationships, which proved essential during times of intense preparation. In a recent competition, our collective effort led to notable improvements, showing the power of working together. Overall, my time in the choir has not only helped me grow as a leader but has also strengthened my skills in resilience, teamwork, and communication, while providing lasting friendships and cherished memories.

<h5>Concert Band</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/performing-arts/concert-band).
    
I have learnt many skills from being in the Concert Band. These skills include playing a new instrument and having a deeper understanding of music.  
  
Being in the Band has taught me important values like responsibility and teamwork as I would not be able to play a nice piece of music without other members of the band. I have also learnt to be confident, especially when performing.  
I have definitely enjoyed making new friends in the Band. The teachers and conductors are very patient and friendly. The people in Band definitely help to make each practice fun and enjoyable. I would most definitely consider joining a band again in the future or even pursue my passion for music and learn music at a higher level.

<h5>Festive Drums</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/performing-arts/festive-drums).
    
I joined Festive Drums without much knowledge but as time passed, my interest for this CCA grew stronger as I started to enjoy every moment, realising it was alright to make mistakes so long as I learnt from them and improved. This love for drumming grew in me while I gained more experience on my drumming journey. Every second has been precious and enjoyable and whenever CCA sessions come to an end, I am always looking forward to the next session.  
  
I enjoy every moment I with my juniors and seniors and am really glad that they are a part of my journey. I really appreciate that I was given a chance to lead. It helped me grow further, not just in terms of values but also in terms of the ability to bond with my CCA members more.  
  
I do not regret selecting Festive Drums as one of my choices. This CCA has taught me teamwork, perseverance, responsibility and many other values. Over time, drumming has turned into a passion for me and it has never stopped growing. Our instructor is also always looking out for us, giving us feedback and helping us in many ways like teaching us different tactics in memorizing scores and refining the way we hold our drum sticks.  
  
Every performance is precious to me as we have watched each other grow from being anxious before the performance to developing confidence and achieving the sense of satisfaction after each performance. We have built a passionate team with strong synchronization and I’m really glad to be in this CCA.

<h5>Guzheng</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/performing-arts/guzheng).
        
Guzheng CCA taught me how to express my emotion through music. Each piece of music has its own background story. By playing the Guzheng in different pitches and tones, it allows me to express different emotions and to communicate with the audience through music.  
      
Being a member of Guzheng CCA has given me an opportunity to learn more about teamwork. It requires all members to work together, listen to different sections in order to give our best performance to the audience. This value has had helped me in various school projects as I know the importance of working with my teammates.  
      
I really enjoy the moments when all the sections of the CCA are able to synchronise and create beautiful melodies. I treasure the opportunity to be the Vice President of the Guzheng CCA. It is therefore my responsibility to care for other members and it has helped me to become a better leader.

<h5>Harmonica</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/performing-arts/harmonica).
    
Joining the Harmonica CCA has helped me learn how to read number scores. Prior to joining the CCA, I could only read the 6 line music scores. I can now read number scores easily. This is an important skill that I can bring with me after secondary school.  
  
I have learnt values such as responsibility and patience from this being in the harmonica band. I have to take responsibility for learning new songs so that I am able to play the songs during performances. I have also learnt to be patient when teaching my juniors and members in my section when learning new songs. I enjoy learning to play songs as it is very fun to be able to play a song together with the whole band! I think that performing as a band is the most enjoyable thing to do in the CCA.  
  
The skills and values I learn in the CCA will definitely be applicable to my tertiary education and maybe even the workforce. I would have to be responsible in my work and be able to collaborate well with my future colleagues.

<h5>Modern Dance</h5>

CCA has helped me in many different aspects one of them is learning how to communicate well with others. The skill communication have helped me not only become a better person but also help me lead the CCA well. Communication is key in our CCA, without it, we will not be able to get where we are today. Communicating with others also helped me realise that sometimes there is more than just 1 correct answer. We should learn how to put ourselves in other people’s shoes to see where they are coming from. This has also made me realise my dancers strong points and weak points. Some, I believe have great potential to be better and improved. These can be obtained by making effort to understand my dance members and build strong relationship with them. Therefore, having good communication is the most meaningful skill I have acquired through this CCA.

I have learnt how to have self-discipline, relience, collaborating with others as we work together towards a common goal. I personally really love dancing and being able to dance along side my juniors and seniors have never made me happier to attend my CCA! Seeing how everyone works hard together to put up a spectacular performance really fills me with satisfaction. Not only that, I have also learned how to have the self-determination and self-discipline to improve on myself so that i can work even better with my peers!
