<h5>Choir</h5>

Being part of the choir has been an incredibly rewarding journey. Participating in competitions taught me the level of dedication and hard work required to excel, while performing at a hospital for the elderly was a particularly memorable experience. It was fulfilling to connect with and uplift others through our music. Serving as choir president also came with responsibilities that significantly contributed to my personal growth. Leading warm-ups and delivering debriefs helped me develop my public speaking skills, and managing the group during rehearsals, like ensuring everyone stayed focused, strengthened my leadership and organizational abilities. Though initially daunting, these tasks ultimately boosted my confidence in addressing large groups and keeping the team on track.

The teamwork and camaraderie within the choir were equally important. Bonding through fun games during trainings helped us build strong relationships, which proved essential during times of intense preparation. In a recent competition, our collective effort led to notable improvements, showing the power of working together. Overall, my time in the choir has not only helped me grow as a leader but has also strengthened my skills in resilience, teamwork, and communication, while providing lasting friendships and cherished memories.

Being part of the Concert Band CCA has been a rewarding experience both musically and personally. The band has provided me with the opportunity to learn new instruments and deepen my appreciation for music. The discipline required for consistent practice has taught me values like perseverance and patience.

Additionally, the friendships I've formed with fellow band members have made rehearsals more enjoyable, and collaborating to perfect performances has strengthened our teamwork. I've learned to step out of my comfort zone and perform with confidence, which has positively impacted other areas of my life as well. Overall, my time in the band has been unforgettable, and I am eager to continue pursuing music in the future.

<h5>ELDDS</h5>

Being in ELDDS since Sec 1 has been an enriching experience. It has allowed me to attend and be a part of many performances over the years, such as watching the ‘I And You’ play by Lauren Gunderson at Gateway Theatre, performing in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and participating in the school’s annual National Day celebration.

What I love the most about ELDDS is that it provides members with the opportunity to for creative expression and collaboration. I also get to participate in games that train me in important theatrical skills, as well as foster camaraderie among my peers. Through ELDDS, I have developed various competencies, such as public speaking, leadership skills, and empathy. As a whole, ELDDS has helped me to improve my intrapersonal and interpersonal skills, as well as allow me to experience and appreciate the beauty of theatre, which has helped me to shape who I am today.

<h5>Festive Drums</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/performing-arts/festive-drums).
    
Before joining Festive Drums, I had no knowledge of this CCA at all. However as the years passed, I grew a deep fondness for this CCA and enjoyed every single moment of this CCA. Festive Drums helped me meet new friends and experiment with new things. 

Throughout the three years in this CCA, I have learned to appreciate the time I spent with this CCA, with my peers and juniors. I have learned many values like teamwork and perseverance, which are life long values and will remain rooted in me for a long time. 

Performing in front of a big audience not only in school but also at outside venues made me step out of my comfort zone and face my fears. From our first performance to our last, I felt that all members have actually grown emotionally, from being anxious and worried to being confident and excited. I look forward to making more memories with all my peers!

<h5>Guzheng</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/performing-arts/guzheng).
        
Guzheng CCA taught me how to express my emotion through music. Each piece of music has its own background story. By playing the Guzheng in different pitches and tones, it allows me to express different emotions and to communicate with the audience through music.  
      
Being a member of Guzheng CCA has given me an opportunity to learn more about teamwork. It requires all members to work together, listen to different sections in order to give our best performance to the audience. This value has had helped me in various school projects as I know the importance of working with my teammates.  
      
I really enjoy the moments when all the sections of the CCA are able to synchronise and create beautiful melodies. I treasure the opportunity to be the Vice President of the Guzheng CCA. It is therefore my responsibility to care for other members and it has helped me to become a better leader.

<h5>Harmonica</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/performing-arts/harmonica).
    
Joining the Harmonica CCA has helped me learn how to read number scores. Prior to joining the CCA, I could only read the 6 line music scores. I can now read number scores easily. This is an important skill that I can bring with me after secondary school.  
  
I have learnt values such as responsibility and patience from this being in the harmonica band. I have to take responsibility for learning new songs so that I am able to play the songs during performances. I have also learnt to be patient when teaching my juniors and members in my section when learning new songs. I enjoy learning to play songs as it is very fun to be able to play a song together with the whole band! I think that performing as a band is the most enjoyable thing to do in the CCA.  
  
The skills and values I learn in the CCA will definitely be applicable to my tertiary education and maybe even the workforce. I would have to be responsible in my work and be able to collaborate well with my future colleagues.

<h5>Modern Dance</h5>

CCA has helped me in many different aspects one of them is learning how to communicate well with others. The skill communication have helped me not only become a better person but also help me lead the CCA well. Communication is key in our CCA, without it, we will not be able to get where we are today. Communicating with others also helped me realise that sometimes there is more than just 1 correct answer. We should learn how to put ourselves in other people’s shoes to see where they are coming from. This has also made me realise my dancers strong points and weak points. Some, I believe have great potential to be better and improved. These can be obtained by making effort to understand my dance members and build strong relationship with them. Therefore, having good communication is the most meaningful skill I have acquired through this CCA.

I have learnt how to have self-discipline, relience, collaborating with others as we work together towards a common goal. I personally really love dancing and being able to dance along side my juniors and seniors have never made me happier to attend my CCA! Seeing how everyone works hard together to put up a spectacular performance really fills me with satisfaction. Not only that, I have also learned how to have the self-determination and self-discipline to improve on myself so that i can work even better with my peers!
