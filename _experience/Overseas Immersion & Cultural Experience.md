<p>From 3-8 November 2024, 26 students and 5 teachers embarked on an enriching
Shanghai immersion programme to develop their global literacy and inventive
thinking. Students actively participated in pre-trip planning and engaged
in meaningful exchanges at Luwan Middle School, learning alongside local
buddies through regular classes and innovative 3D printing workshops.&nbsp;The
programme balanced cutting-edge innovation with cultural heritage through
visits to Apollo Baidu Factory, East China UAV Base, and Shanghai Urban
Planning Center, alongside traditional sites like Yu Garden, Tianzifang,
and&nbsp;Zhujiajao&nbsp;water town. This comprehensive experience successfully

<p>From 10-14 November 2024, 30 students and 6 teachers embarked on an immersive
learning journey to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The programme aimed to develop
students’ global literacy, deepen their appreciation of culture and the
humanities, and foster collaboration and communication skills through shared
experiences. Students engaged in meaningful exchanges during a service-learning
project at Maison Chance village school, where they contributed actively
to the local community. The itinerary offered rich insights into Vietnam’s
history and geography, with visits to the War Remnants Museum, Cu Chi Tunnels,
and the Mekong Delta at My Tho. Cultural highlights such as a traditional
water puppet show and exploration of Ben Thanh Market further broadened
students’ perspectives. The trip successfully combined experiential learning,
cultural immersion, and social contribution, leaving participants with
enhanced skills, deeper appreciation of the region, and lasting memories.</p>

<h4><strong>Cambodia Overseas Immersion Trip Write-Up 2024</strong></h4>
<p>
<br>From 10 to 14 November 2024, 27 Secondary 2 and 3 students embarked on
a meaningful and eye-opening journey to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, as part of
our school’s Overseas Cultural Immersion Programme. This experience was
designed to nurture cultural agility, deepen intercultural understanding,
and foster a spirit of global friendship.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the programme was a vibrant cultural exchange
at&nbsp;<em>Pras Khan Chey Bokator School</em>, where our students introduced&nbsp;Taekwondo&nbsp;as
a discipline rooted in respect, perseverance, and self-mastery. In return,
they were introduced to the traditional Cambodian martial art of&nbsp;Bokator&nbsp;—
a powerful expression of Cambodia’s heritage and resilience.</p>
<p>This dynamic exchange not only celebrated martial arts, but also built
bridges of mutual curiosity and appreciation between both groups of youths.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of their bicultural learning, students also engaged in school
exchanges with both&nbsp;<em>Chroy Chonya High School</em>, an urban school,
and&nbsp;<em>Thomsras Secondary School</em>, located in a rural village.
Through collaborative games and informal conversations, friendships blossomed
— and meaningful growth unfolded on both sides.&nbsp;Our students took
on leadership roles as they&nbsp;planned and executed bonding activities,
interactive games, and a basic Taekwondo session, creating shared moments
of joy and learning for their Cambodian peers.</p>
<p>These interactions gave Cambodian students the opportunity to practise
their English with confidence, while our students honed cultural agility
and empathy, making new friends while navigating new environments with
openness and heart.</p>
<p>“My favourite memory from the immersion experience was getting to know
my Secondary 3 seniors better and forging deeper bonds with both them and
my level mates. Through our shared experiences, I discovered that I am
capable of stepping out of my comfort zone — to lead, to present, and to
make new friends with confidence. I was especially inspired by the Cambodian
youths, who reminded me to be grateful for even the simplest things in
life, like a warm meal or the presence of newfound friends.”</p>

<p>This immersive experience left an indelible mark on our students, who
returned not only with new friendships and skills, but with a deeper understanding
of themselves and the world. As global citizens, they were reminded that
while languages and customs may differ, the heart of human connection —
mutual respect, curiosity, and kindness — transcends borders.</p>
