<p>From 3-8 November 2024, 26 students and 5 teachers embarked on an enriching
Shanghai immersion programme to develop their global literacy and inventive
thinking. Students actively participated in pre-trip planning and engaged
in meaningful exchanges at Luwan Middle School, learning alongside local
buddies through regular classes and innovative 3D printing workshops.&nbsp;The
programme balanced cutting-edge innovation with cultural heritage through
visits to Apollo Baidu Factory, East China UAV Base, and Shanghai Urban
Planning Center, alongside traditional sites like Yu Garden, Tianzifang,
and&nbsp;Zhujiajao&nbsp;water town. This comprehensive experience successfully
combined educational discovery with cultural appreciation, fostering global
perspectives whilst creating lasting memories for all students.</p>
