<p><strong>TAEKWONDO</strong>
</p>
<p>I have learnt a lot of things in CCA. CCA taught me to be more direct
and confident, and it influenced me to lead a better and physical lifestyle
and I started to exercise on my own. However I am most grateful to meet
many people I treasure, such as cca mates, people who participated in the
taekwondo NSG, and even my coaches. Without my cca I wouldn’t have met
these amazing people, and that’s what I love most.</p>

<p><strong>SHOOTING</strong>
</p>
<p>Being part of Shooting CCA is something I am proud of. It’s not just about
shooting targets—it’s a journey that teaches me focus, patience, and discipline
more than any classroom ever could. Every session, we train our mind to
stay calm under pressure and nurture our patience, building good habits
in our life. I was also given a chance by this CCA to become the Vice-Captain,
allowing me to gain leadership skills, which I am thoroughly grateful for.
I enjoyed making new friends along the way, with my coaches and teachers
guiding me step by step, and a closely-knitted team that supports and pushes
me to become who I am today.</p>

<p><strong>SOFTBALL</strong>
</p>
<p>Softball is a challenging yet rewarding team sport that instils important
life values and builds strong character. Edgefield’s Softball fosters a
strong team spirit where everyone strives to be their best, pushing for
constant self-improvement, and undeniably creating a fruitful, fulfilling
and worthwhile softball journey.</p>

<p><strong>BADMINTON</strong>
</p>
<p>My three years of badminton CCA in secondary school have been really meaningful.
Every year’s NSG is always very memorable with my teammates going through
the seasons together regardless of what we can achieve. As captain, I learned
how to work with my teammates, encourage them, and also improve myself.
It wasn’t always easy, but the fun, teamwork, and growth made this journey
truly unforgettable.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>BASKETBALL</strong>
</p>
<p>Edgefield Basketball taught me that heart matters more than size. I’ve
played against taller, stronger players, but what sets you apart isn’t
how big you are, it’s how hard you fight. It’s not about height, it’s about
hunger, hustle, and never backing down.</p>

<p><strong>VOLLEYBALL</strong>
</p>
<p>My CCA in Edgefield has been meaningful and full of growth. When I first
joined the CCA, i struggled immensely with my basic skills and lacked confidence.
But through consistent practice and encouragement from my seniors, teachers
and coach, I gradually improved and became more confident. Along the way,
I have learned the value of resilience - how to push through no matter
how tiring or tough things get and not to give up even after repeated mistakes.
Volleyball has taught me the importance of communication and teamwork -especially
during the competition. I’ve come to understand that winning isn't everything
and what truly matters is our effort, attitude and how we support one another.
My CCA has helped me build confidence, discipline and a stronger sense
of responsibility both as a teammate and an individual.</p>

<p><strong>WUSHU</strong>
</p>
<p>Through my journey as a CCA leader, I learned that leadership isn’t about
being the loudest voice, but the clearest. I learned to listen, guide,
and stand firm with my team through challenges, rather than trying to show
off or outshine others.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ROBOTICS</strong>
</p>
<p>"Through my involvement in the Robotics Club, I have learnt to be resilient,
persistent, and able to persevere through hardships while forging strong
relationships with people along the way. Both external competitions and
in-house competitions have significantly shaped my critical thinking skills
and have fundamentally changed how I approach challenges when faced with
difficulties. I am incredibly grateful to be part of the Robotics Club
and to have had the opportunity to grow in my role as Vice- President.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ART CLUB</strong>
</p>
<p>Art Club has been a fulfilling journey—where I grew as an artist, a leader,
and a friend. Every moment spent creating, learning, and connecting is
one I truly treasure.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>CHOIR</strong>
</p>
<p>Being a leader isn’t easy — there are many challenges and tough moments.
But at the end of the day, when you see your members happy, you’ll realise
that all the effort was worth it.</p>
<p><strong><em>FELICIA CHIA, 3ES</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>CONCERT BAND</strong>
</p>
<p>Being a student leader in Concert Band taught me that leadership is about
responsibility, communication, and trust. It’s not about commanding people,
but about connecting members with teachers and conductors, supporting the
team, and making decisions with the band’s best interests at heart.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>DANCE</strong>
</p>
<p>We enjoy our CCA because it’s a lively, welcoming place for all, regardless
of class, level, or background. Through training and PT, we’ve developed
endurance, resilience, and respect for dance culture, motivating us to
participate actively and look forward to each practice.</p>

<p><strong>SCOUTS</strong>
</p>
<p>The Scout's motto, ""Be Prepared"", has been critical in my growth as
a person. Whether it is in my examinations, projects or relationships,
living by this motto reminds me of the need to be ready for all situations.</p>
<p><strong><em>LEONG WEI ZHE KENDRICK, 3ES </em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>NPCC (SEA)</strong>
</p>
<p>NPCC has transformed me greatly, from my very first session as a cadet
to my current role as a cadet leader. Every hardship, challenge, and achievement
has given me new experiences that I would never have found in any other
CCA. Being part of such a disciplined CCA has taught me important values
such as respect, discipline, teamwork, and resilience.</p>
<p>As I grew into leadership, I learnt that being a leader is not just about
giving instructions, but about caring for and protecting those you lead,
and guiding them with a shared vision. These experiences have shown me
the importance of empathy and service, which I know are at the heart of
NPCC’s mission to build compassionate leaders who contribute to a safe
and resilient Singapore.</p>
<p>Through NPCC, I have learnt to adapt to challenges, stay committed to
excellence, and serve with integrity. Most importantly, NPCC has shaped
me into someone who strives to make a meaningful difference in my community.
Thank you, NPCC, for shaping the person I am today.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>NCDCC</strong>
</p>
<p>Throughout my time in NCDCC, I've not only learnt essential life-saving
skills, but also become more disciplined and a better leader. NCDCC has
guided me to become a better person, and I wouldn't be who I am today without
it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zayan Aftab (3EV)</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>GIRL GUIDES</strong>
</p>
<p>My time in Girl Guides has been very meaningful. Not only did I learn
essential life skills, I also formed strong bonds with my fellow Girl Guides
and got the opportunity to contribute as a leader. I really enjoy being
a member of Girl Guides!</p>
