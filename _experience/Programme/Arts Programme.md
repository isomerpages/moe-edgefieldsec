_“Since I first laid eyes on a book, I have always had a passion for writing. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed Literature classes and writing essays in English lessons. Through these lessons and numerous competitions I participated in, I have learnt to better appreciate other people’s works while also improving mine. The whole writing process encourages me to think critically and logically while artfully piecing my ideas together, which I find immense satisfaction in. I believe that a good command of the languages will lay a strong foundation for learning other subjects and allow us to communicate our ideas effectively. It is my dream to become a professional writer in the future so that I can inspire others with my words and impart my love for Language and Literature.”_
