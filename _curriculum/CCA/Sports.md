“I enjoy being in a sports CCA because it allows me to learn many important values which we can apply in the future. Everyone in the Badminton Team has a common interest thus we connect well and create a friendly and conducive environment for our training. Furthermore, going through hardships with each other helps form a sense of camaraderie. We would look out for each other, have fun together, and develop our badminton skills together. Finally, during the annual National School Games (NSG), our skills and nerves are put to the test, as we represent Edgefield to compete with many other schools, under pressure and facing different opponents. We need to learn how to keep a cool head in order to play out our best. During the NSG, our team encouraged each other to persevere, and we ultimately clinched 3rd place in the North Zone. This was a reflection of our commitment, perseverance and unity as a team!”

Basketball has been a pivotal part of my life since I first played in primary school. Joining the school team as captain of the girls’ basketball team in secondary school was a significant step for me. It provided a platform to develop my skills, build friendships, and learn valuable life lessons.

Practices were intense and often challenging, instilling discipline and perseverance in all of us, thanks to the support of my coach, teachers, and seniors. As captain, I focused not only on improving my own game but also on encouraging my teammates. Through countless drills and scrimmages, I honed my shooting, passing, and defensive strategies, gaining confidence with each session.

One of the most memorable moments was our championship game in the 2023 C Division. The atmosphere was electric, with our seniors and the boys' basketball team cheering us on. Despite the pressure, I felt a deep sense of unity with my teammates, each of us focused on a common goal. The exhilaration of that game remains one of my proudest achievements. Even though we lost, making it to the finals demonstrated that our efforts paid off, but we still had room for improvement.

Beyond the physical aspects of the game, basketball taught me about resilience. We faced many losses, but each defeat was an opportunity to learn and grow. The camaraderie I built with my teammates transformed into lasting friendships, creating a support system that extended beyond the court.

My basketball experience in secondary school has shaped who I am today. It has taught me about leadership, teamwork, perseverance, and the joy of pursuing a passion. I am grateful for the memories and lessons learned, which I will carry with me long after my school days.

<h5>Shooting</h5>
		
**For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/sports/shooting).**
    
Shooting as a CCA has sharpened my ability to stay calm and focused under pressure, a skill that is crucial in achieving accuracy during competitions. The sport demands intense concentration, quick decision-making, and physical control, all of which I have developed through regular training and challenging match conditions.<br>
Beyond skill, Shooting has instilled in me important values such as discipline, perseverance, and teamwork. I have learned the importance of remaining composed when things do not go as planned, and the value of supporting one another as a team. What I enjoy most is the strong camaraderie within the CCA — the shared experiences, from training sessions to the adrenaline of competitions, have created bonds I will always treasure.<br>
These skills and values will serve me well in the future, both in my studies and career. The focus and discipline I have gained will help me tackle complex challenges, while perseverance and teamwork will enable me to work effectively with others in any environment. Most importantly, the confidence built through leading as Captain has prepared me to take on leadership roles beyond school.<br>

<h5>Softball</h5>

Softball is definitely a tough sport. As the captain of the team, I’ve learned that training under the hot sun can be challenging, testing our physical and mental limits. The game has many rules, and it takes time to get the hang of them, but once you do, it’s incredibly fun.

My teammates play a crucial role in this journey. Their support and camaraderie create an environment where we can push each other to improve. We celebrate our victories together and learn from our losses, fostering a strong team spirit.

Throughout this experience, I’ve gained valuable life lessons. I’ve learned the importance of teamwork, discipline, and determination. There were times when I felt like giving up, but as the Captain of the CCA, I realised I needed to push through—not just for myself, but to set a positive example for my teammates.

Being part of this team has not only enhanced my softball skills but also taught me about leadership and the value of hard work. I am proud to lead such an incredible group, and I look forward to what we can achieve together!

<h5>Volleyball</h5>

**For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/sports/volleyball-boys).**

Volleyball is the single best sport for fostering holistic development, covering every dimension, from the physical aspects of explosive power, stamina, and reaction time, to the mental qualities of mindset, work ethic, and values.&nbsp;

My journey as part of Edgefield Secondary School's volleyball team has been instrumental in shaping who I am today. There are lessons that simply cannot be taught by pen and paper. Instead, these lessons have become ingrained in me through the invaluable experiences I've been through in this CCA.

Volleyball has taught me that setbacks and losses are not failures, but stepping stones on the path to success. I’ve learned to stay focused, bounce back from mistakes, and maintain a positive attitude, even in the face of adversity. Through this sport, I’ve adopted unwavering self-discipline, which has extended beyond the court to my personal and academic life. Juggling both volleyball and my studies has demanded solid time management and high stress tolerance from me, which I am utterly grateful for.

What stands out to me is the strength of teamwork. Volleyball has shown me that for a team to succeed, every member must contribute their best. This understanding has brought my teammates and me closer together. We uplift each other by encouraging one another to remain steadfast and determined both on and off the court, creating a positive cycle of growth and achievement.

If you’re looking for a CCA that pushes your limits and fosters growth in every aspect of your life, come join us. Feel the energy as “EDGEFIELD! ACE! ACE! ACE!!” echoes throughout the school every Monday and Thursday!

<h5>Wushu</h5>
		
**For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/sports/wushu).**
 
 Wushu is a dynamic martial art that combines agility, strength, and discipline. As part of the Wushu Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), I have the opportunity to train in traditional Chinese martial arts, including barehand forms and various weapon routines. Wushu helps me improve flexibility, coordination, and endurance while fostering values such as perseverance, discipline, and teamwork. Through both individual and group routines, Wushu members can participate in the National School Games, gaining valuable competitive experience. 
As a member of the Wushu CCA, I have developed important skills such as resilience and self-discipline, preparing me for the future. Although Wushu has been both physically and mentally demanding, the support of my CCA friends has helped me push through challenges and enjoy my training. Despite the grueling training sessions, I learn a variety of weapons and techniques, and constantly improve with the guidance of the coach. I find the experience rewarding although my muscles were sore after training sessions, as it was a sign of the effort I put into training. 
Now, as a captain, I am motivated to go the extra mile during training to inspire my fellow CCA members to work hard. This leadership role has also encouraged me to be more social, interact with more people, and develop better communication skills. Being a captain has made me realize how valuable my CCA experience is and has taught me to cherish the friendships and bonds I have formed within the team. <br>
Wushu instills discipline and perseverance, as students must practise consistently to master techniques. This helps to build a strong work ethic and resilience for future challenges. It also fosters confidence, as performing in competitions and events helps me overcome stage fright and improve public speaking. Additionally, teamwork and leadership skills are developed through group training, where seniors guide juniors, preparing students for collaborative environments in school and the workplace. These qualities make Wushu not just a sport, but a valuable foundation for future success, giving me an edge in facing life’s challenges. <br>

Wushu is both a sport and a Chinese martial art that involves performing in events and competing in the National School Games, either individually or as part of a group. Wushu goes beyond mere strength and agility; it instills discipline, as it requires consistent practice and dedication to master routines and techniques. 
As a member of the Wushu CCA, I have learned multiple valuable life lessons, such as resilience. Since Wushu is a physically demanding sport, it has taught me to overcome challenges and push through difficult training sessions. However, I have also experienced the strong team spirit within our group, as we cheer one another on - even during regular training. This further motivates me and gives me strength when I struggle, helping me push forward and persevere.
