I was involved in the many school events, competitions and workshops provided by Art Club. Each and every one helped me to grow not only artistically by exposing me to different mediums, but has also allowed me to bond with my schoolmates. Even as the Art Club President, I was able to develop and improve consistently, and build confidence in my leadership. I hope to continue to grow with my schoolmates and inspire the next batch of artists. I hope to continue to grow with my schoolmates and inspire the next batch of artists.

Throughout my journey in NMC, I have learnt multiple things. From leading a whole CCA to managing events, I’ve grown in confidence, learnt how to work with different people, and discovered the importance of communication and planning. 

It wasn’t always easy, but every experience—good or bad—taught me something valuable. Most importantly, I’ve built friendships and memories that made my time here truly meaningful.

Over the course of my school life in SYFC, I have been given the opportunity to interact with students who share my passion for aviation. CCA sessions include building our knowledge in aviation, hands-on activities to train our skills in building gliders, and also flying drones. Another activity I love doing in my CCA would also be learning new flight simulator skills and also flying via a circuit pattern in the flight simulator application that we use each CCA session. I also appreciate being able to learn more about aerodynamics. Participating in the annual Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition enabled me to apply flight theory in designing gliders.

The provision of opportunities to work with my peers and learn more about aeromodelling from them makes me enjoy being part of the CCA.

Being a CCA leader gives me opportunities to lead and share my knowledge and skills with my CCA mates. It has also cultivated a sense of perseverance and responsibility as a student leader. Even though there have been many ups and downs in my leadership journey, I would always reflect and take these opportunities for me to grow as a leader, and streng then the CCA.

<h5>Robotics Club</h5>

Throughout these three years of involvement with the Robotics Club, I have experienced mixed feelings — moments that have been joyful, anxious, surprising, and even fearful. This spectrum of emotions has absolutely helped in shaping my personal growth and skill development, while essentially providing me with leadership opportunities. Looking back, I am honoured to be a proud member of the Robotics Club, and these varied experiences have ultimately strengthened my character and resolve.

Through my involvement in the Robotics Club, I have learnt to be resilient, persistent, and able to persevere through hardships while forging strong relationships with people along the way. Both external competitions and in-house competitions have significantly shaped my critical thinking skills and have fundamentally changed how I approach challenges when faced with difficulties. I am incredibly grateful to be part of the Robotics Club and to have had the opportunity to grow in my role as Vice- President.
