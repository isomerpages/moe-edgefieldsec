<h5>Art Club</h5>

I was involved in the many school events, competitions and workshops provided by Art Club. Each and every one helped me to grow not only artistically by exposing me to different mediums, but has also allowed me to bond with my schoolmates. Even as the Art Club President, I was able to develop and improve consistently, and build confidence in my leadership. I hope to continue to grow with my schoolmates and inspire the next batch of artists. I hope to continue to grow with my schoolmates and inspire the next batch of artists.

<h5>New Media Club</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/clubs/new-media-club).
    
New Media Club enables us to learn both technical and soft skills required in Audio Visual management. Learning the ins and outs of managing an event requires us to be proficient in operating the various equipment and in communicating well with each other. The CCA also gives us plenty of opportunities to partake in school events to ensure that the event runs smoothly.  
  
Not only that, we can hone our photography and videography skills through our participation in competitions each year. We are encouraged to use our creativity to come up with interesting photos and videos that fit the theme of the competition. We also learn to work together in team competitions.  
  
The CCA also takes us to places such as Gardens by The Bay where we took photos of the plants and enjoyed friendly competitions with each other. Such experiences give us all a chance to bond together and get to know one another better.  
  
The photography and videography technical skills as well as the AV management skills would come in handy when we choose related courses in our Post-secondary journey. One key skill that we have picked up in this CCA is that of leadership and teamwork. By managing and leading school events, we can be prepared to take on a leadership role in the future and learn to work under pressure. Working with each other allows us to learn to work with others and will definitely be useful when we are in a team-based workspace.

<h5>Singapore Youth Flying Club</h5>

Over the course of my school life in SYFC, I have been given the opportunity to interact with students who share my passion for aviation. CCA sessions include building our knowledge in aviation, hands-on activities to train our skills in building gliders, and also flying drones. Another activity I love doing in my CCA would also be learning new flight simulator skills and also flying via a circuit pattern in the flight simulator application that we use each CCA session. I also appreciate being able to learn more about aerodynamics. Participating in the annual Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition enabled me to apply flight theory in designing gliders.

The provision of opportunities to work with my peers and learn more about aeromodelling from them makes me enjoy being part of the CCA.

Being a CCA leader gives me opportunities to lead and share my knowledge and skills with my CCA mates. It has also cultivated a sense of perseverance and responsibility as a student leader. Even though there have been many ups and downs in my leadership journey, I would always reflect and take these opportunities for me to grow as a leader, and streng then the CCA.

<h5>Robotics Club</h5>

Throughout these three years of involvement with the Robotics Club, I have experienced mixed feelings â€” moments that have been joyful, anxious, surprising, and even fearful. This spectrum of emotions has absolutely helped in shaping my personal growth and skill development, while essentially providing me with leadership opportunities. Looking back, I am honoured to be a proud member of the Robotics Club, and these varied experiences have ultimately strengthened my character and resolve.

Through my involvement in the Robotics Club, I have learnt to be resilient, persistent, and able to persevere through hardships while forging strong relationships with people along the way. Both external competitions and in-house competitions have significantly shaped my critical thinking skills and have fundamentally changed how I approach challenges when faced with difficulties. I am incredibly grateful to be part of the Robotics Club and to have had the opportunity to grow in my role as Vice- President.
