From my experience in Girl Guides, I have learned the importance of having a passion for sharing knowledge and compassion towards the junior Guides.<br><br>
The CCA enabled me to develop my leadership skills. I am able to communicate more openly and effectively with others. For instance, during patrol bonding sessions or activities that involve teamwork, the CCA helped me communicate better with different people who possess different qualities by engaging with them and accomplishing tasks together with them, which opened up new perspectives of communication with different types of people. 1. Teamwork

&gt; 1) Team Work:
&gt;  I enjoy working with my CCA peers to learn new skills and build strong relationships with them.
&gt; 2) Adaptability &amp; Creativity: 
&gt; The CCA has taught me to be spontaneous and adaptable as sometimes things don't work out as planned resulting in us having to adjust and be creative by making use of what we do have to go on with the CCA session.
&gt; 3) Social Responsibility: 
&gt; The CCA has made me mindful of the impact of my actions towards the people around me and in my community.

<h5>NPCC (Sea)</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/uniformed-groups/npcc-sea).

My journey in NPCC (Sea) has equipped me with essential skills in leadership, time management, and project coordination. From leading the CSSP project to planning large-scale events like the National Day Observance Ceremony, I’ve learned to delegate tasks, plan ahead, and adapt to challenges—often while balancing heavy academic loads. These real-world experiences sharpened my ability to solve problems, lead with confidence, and work effectively under pressure.

NPCC has shaped my character by instilling resilience, integrity, service, and excellence. What I enjoy most is the camaraderie built through shared goals and the meaningful bonds formed with fellow cadets and leaders. Stepping out of my comfort zone—like leading school-wide events and guiding others—taught me to lead with compassion, take responsibility, and appreciate the power of teamwork.

The values and experiences I’ve gained through NPCC will stay with me well beyond my time in school. Whether it’s in higher education, future careers, or contributing to society, I know that the skills of adaptability, collaboration, and leadership will guide me. NPCC has given me more than just CCA memories—it has prepared me to be a confident, compassionate leader ready to face future challenges.

<h5>NCDCC</h5>

NCDCC has equipped me with valuable leadership skills, such as managing large groups, planning large-scale activities, and communicating effectively with different stakeholders. I've learned to stay calm under pressure and approach challenges with a clear and level-headed mindset, regardless of the situation.
  
Among all the experiences I've had in NCDCC, the most memorable and enjoyable moments were spent with my seniors — whether working together on badgework or participating in various activities. These interactions taught me a lot and made my journey in the CCA especially meaningful.
  
Looking back, I’m confident that the skills and experiences I’ve gained through NCDCC will continue to benefit me in the future. I’m truly grateful that, out of all the CCAs I could have chosen, I had the opportunity to be part of NCDCC.

<h5>Scouts</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/uniformed-groups/scouts).

My CCA, Scouts, has helped me by teaching me valuable skills that are essential for camping through different activities and camps. Not only that, I have also fostered new mindsets through CCA training such as to never give up and keep trying. Together with my peers, those mindsets help us get through challenges, both in and out of CCA.&nbsp;

Through my fulfilling journey in Scouts, I’ve learnt the importance of resilience, teamwork, and discipline. Whether it’s pushing through tough training sessions or working closely with my CCA mates to achieve a shared goal, these experiences have shaped my character and mindset. What i enjoy is the strong sense of camaraderie within the CCA — it feels like a second family. Every session brings a mix of challenges and fun, and I always look forward to learning something new while growing together with my peers.&nbsp;

The values I’ve learnt — such as resilience, teamwork, and discipline — will definitely help me in the future. Resilience will keep me going when I face challenges in school, work, or life. Teamwork is essential in any job or environment that involves groups, and being able to work well with others is a valuable skill. Discipline helps me stay focused, manage my time, and stay committed to my goals. These lessons from CCA are not just for now — they shape who you are and will prepare you for the real world in the future.
