From my experience in Girl Guides, I have learned the importance of having a passion for sharing knowledge and compassion towards the junior Guides.<br><br>
As an Assistant Company Leader from 2023 to 2024, I have learned to be a role model who was able to inspire my junior Guides and be an approachable mentor for them. After stepping down, watching my juniors grow to be the new generation of leaders to guide the company to greater heights such as the PNA Gold award. During my time in Girl Guides, I was able to create wonderful friendships with other guides from the different events that I had taken part in such as NDP 2023. With this, I hope that many more people will be open to joining uniformed groups, especially Girl Guides, as it is an opportunity to understand and improve your leadership skills. Even if it is hard, to know that there will always be people supporting you, be it the patrol members, juniors, seniors and even the Guiders.
I have learnt the importance of having discipline and compassionate leadership in Girl Guides.

<h5>NPCC (Sea)</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/uniformed-groups/npcc-sea).

My journey in NPCC (Sea) has equipped me with essential skills in leadership, time management, and project coordination. From leading the CSSP project to planning large-scale events like the National Day Observance Ceremony, I’ve learned to delegate tasks, plan ahead, and adapt to challenges—often while balancing heavy academic loads. These real-world experiences sharpened my ability to solve problems, lead with confidence, and work effectively under pressure.

NPCC has shaped my character by instilling resilience, integrity, service, and excellence. What I enjoy most is the camaraderie built through shared goals and the meaningful bonds formed with fellow cadets and leaders. Stepping out of my comfort zone—like leading school-wide events and guiding others—taught me to lead with compassion, take responsibility, and appreciate the power of teamwork.

The values and experiences I’ve gained through NPCC will stay with me well beyond my time in school. Whether it’s in higher education, future careers, or contributing to society, I know that the skills of adaptability, collaboration, and leadership will guide me. NPCC has given me more than just CCA memories—it has prepared me to be a confident, compassionate leader ready to face future challenges.

<h5>NCDCC</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/uniformed-groups/ncdcc).
    
As an NCDCC leader, I have witnessed firsthand the profound impact this CCA has on our cadets. Through rigorous training in first aid, fire safety, and emergency response, our members gain invaluable practical skills that are crucial in real-world situations. 
  
The values we instill—Noble, Caring, Disciplined, Courageous, Commited—are foundational for their personal growth. The cadets take pride in their ability to help others, fostering a strong sense of community spirit. They also enjoy the camaraderie and the hands-on nature of our activities, such as learning the CPR and useful first aid skills, which keep them engaged and motivated.
  
These experiences not only prepare them for potential careers in healthcare or emergency services but also ensure they are well-rounded individuals ready to face future challenges with confidence and compassion.

<h5>Scouts</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/uniformed-groups/scouts).

My CCA, Scouts, has helped me by teaching me valuable skills that are essential for camping through different activities and camps. Not only that, I have also fostered new mindsets through CCA training such as to never give up and keep trying. Together with my peers, those mindsets help us get through challenges, both in and out of CCA.&nbsp;

Through my fulfilling journey in Scouts, I’ve learnt the importance of resilience, teamwork, and discipline. Whether it’s pushing through tough training sessions or working closely with my CCA mates to achieve a shared goal, these experiences have shaped my character and mindset. What i enjoy is the strong sense of camaraderie within the CCA — it feels like a second family. Every session brings a mix of challenges and fun, and I always look forward to learning something new while growing together with my peers.&nbsp;

The values I’ve learnt — such as resilience, teamwork, and discipline — will definitely help me in the future. Resilience will keep me going when I face challenges in school, work, or life. Teamwork is essential in any job or environment that involves groups, and being able to work well with others is a valuable skill. Discipline helps me stay focused, manage my time, and stay committed to my goals. These lessons from CCA are not just for now — they shape who you are and will prepare you for the real world in the future.
