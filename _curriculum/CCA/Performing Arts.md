Being part of the choir has been an incredibly rewarding journey. Participating in competitions taught me the level of dedication and hard work required to excel, while performing at a hospital for the elderly was a particularly memorable experience. It was fulfilling to connect with and uplift others through our music. Serving as choir president also came with responsibilities that significantly contributed to my personal growth. Leading warm-ups and delivering debriefs helped me develop my public speaking skills, and managing the group during rehearsals, like ensuring everyone stayed focused, strengthened my leadership and organizational abilities. Though initially daunting, these tasks ultimately boosted my confidence in addressing large groups and keeping the team on track.

The teamwork and camaraderie within the choir were equally important. Bonding through fun games during trainings helped us build strong relationships, which proved essential during times of intense preparation. In a recent competition, our collective effort led to notable improvements, showing the power of working together. Overall, my time in the choir has not only helped me grow as a leader but has also strengthened my skills in resilience, teamwork, and communication, while providing lasting friendships and cherished memories.

Being part of the Concert Band CCA has been a rewarding experience both musically and personally. The band has provided me with the opportunity to learn new instruments and deepen my appreciation for music. The discipline required for consistent practice has taught me values like perseverance and patience.

Overall, my time in the band has been unforgettable, and I am eager to continue pursuing music in the future.

Being in ELDDS since Sec 1 has been an enriching experience. It has allowed me to attend and be a part of many performances over the years, such as watching the ‘I And You’ play by Lauren Gunderson at Gateway Theatre, performing in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and participating in the school’s annual National Day celebration.

What I love the most about ELDDS is that it provides members with the opportunity to for creative expression and collaboration. I also get to participate in games that train me in important theatrical skills, as well as foster camaraderie among my peers. Through ELDDS, I have developed various competencies, such as public speaking, leadership skills, and empathy. As a whole, ELDDS has helped me to improve my intrapersonal and interpersonal skills, as well as allow me to experience and appreciate the beauty of theatre, which has helped me to shape who I am today.

<h5>Festive Drums</h5>

Before joining Festive Drums, I had no knowledge of this CCA at all. However as the years passed, I grew a deep fondness for this CCA and enjoyed every single moment of this CCA. Festive Drums helped me meet new friends and experiment with new things. 

Throughout the three years in this CCA, I have learned to appreciate the time I spent with this CCA, with my peers and juniors. I have learned many values like teamwork and perseverance, which are life long values and will remain rooted in me for a long time. 

Performing in front of a big audience not only in school but also at outside venues made me step out of my comfort zone and face my fears. From our first performance to our last, I felt that all members have actually grown emotionally, from being anxious and worried to being confident and excited. I look forward to making more memories with all my peers!

<h5>Guzheng</h5>

As the president of the Guzheng Ensemble my journey has been both rewarding and enriching. Leading a group of talented guzheng players has provided me with invaluable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and resilience. One of the most fulfilling aspects of this role has been witnessing our members’ growth, not only in their musical skills but also in their confidence to perform before an audience.

This leadership experience has also underscored the importance of discipline and time management. Balancing my academic responsibilities with CCA commitments has taught me to prioritise tasks and stay organised. Through this, I have gained a deeper appreciation for hard work and perseverance, as our consistent efforts led to improved performances and a stronger sense of unity within the team.

The most memorable moments have been performing together, especially during major events like our annual Open House. The harmony we create as a team reflects not only our musical abilities but also the strong bond we’ve formed over time. As President, I am proud of how far we’ve come and look forward to seeing the continued success of our Guzheng Ensemble in the future.

As the vice president of the Guzheng Ensemble, our journey has been one of growth, learning, and a deepening connection to music. Together, we’ve faced challenges—from mastering difficult pieces to balancing schoolwork with practice—but each obstacle has only strengthened our bond.

Performing at various events, both within school and beyond, has been incredibly rewarding. Each performance reflects hours of dedication, teamwork, and the excitement of bringing beautiful music to life. Along this journey, we’ve grown not just as musicians but as a cohesive team, supporting each other through both successes and setbacks.

Our experience isn’t just about mastering the Guzheng; it’s about sharing our passion for music with others and learning valuable lessons in leadership, discipline, and collaboration. The friendships we’ve built and the skills we’ve gained make this journey truly unforgettable, and we look forward to continuing to grow together.

Ever since we joined the Harmonica CCA, we have learnt how to play a new instrument and appreciated the diverse genres of music. From rousing pop music to melodious classical tunes, we take delight in the joyous performances of these beautiful music pieces with every member of the band.&nbsp;Even if one does not have any musical background, it is not too hard to master the harmonica!&nbsp;

Being CCA leaders has also taught us many valuable lessons. From leading the juniors, especially at areas they are struggling with, to inspiring teamwork in the band, not only do we hone our leadership skills, we are also humbled&nbsp;by what we can learn from other members. In our growth&nbsp;and development as a leader, we have grown to be confident and empathetic, becoming better versions of ourselves.&nbsp; Beyond the CCA, the&nbsp;values of resilience and perseverance are also applied in our classroom learning, helping us stay focused on our goals and improving our performances.&nbsp;

Through the many practices and performances, we have created deeper bonds within the band as we encourage and support one another along this journey of music making. Harmonica CCA has certainly brought us closer together despite our diverse backgrounds and personalities, helping us to better appreciate the beauty in diversity.

CCA has helped me in many different aspects one of them is learning how to communicate well with others. The skill communication have helped me not only become a better person but also help me lead the CCA well. Communication is key in our CCA, without it, we will not be able to get where we are today. Communicating with others also helped me realise that sometimes there is more than just 1 correct answer. We should learn how to put ourselves in other people’s shoes to see where they are coming from. This has also made me realise my dancers strong points and weak points. Some, I believe have great potential to be better and improved. These can be obtained by making effort to understand my dance members and build strong relationship with them. Therefore, having good communication is the most meaningful skill I have acquired through this CCA.

I have learnt how to have self-discipline, relience, collaborating with others as we work together towards a common goal. I personally really love dancing and being able to dance along side my juniors and seniors have never made me happier to attend my CCA! Seeing how everyone works hard together to put up a spectacular performance really fills me with satisfaction. Not only that, I have also learned how to have the self-determination and self-discipline to improve on myself so that i can work even better with my peers!
