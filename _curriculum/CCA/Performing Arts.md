<h5>Choir</h5>

Being in choir has helped me develop leadership and communication skills. As Choir President, I was given the opportunity to lead the group during physical training and singing practices. I had to learn how to guide others, communicate clearly, and understand things from my members’ perspectives. Standing in front of the entire choir was a challenge at first, but it helped me grow in confidence and learn what it truly means to lead.

Through choir, I have learnt important values such as perseverance, teamwork, and self-confidence. I’ve also learnt to be true to myself even when performing in front of large crowds, where it’s easy to feel judged. What I enjoy most about choir is the strong sense of camaraderie—we are not just singing, we are growing together and supporting one another like a team.

The leadership skills, confidence, and resilience I have built in choir will definitely help me in the future. Whether it’s in job interviews, public speaking, or career opportunities, I now feel more equipped to present myself, connect with others, and stay grounded in who I am. Instead of seeking approval from everyone, I’ve learnt to focus on staying true to my own journey—and that’s something I will carry with me for life.

Being part of the Concert Band CCA has been a rewarding experience both musically and personally. The band has provided me with the opportunity to learn new instruments and deepen my appreciation for music. The discipline required for consistent practice has taught me values like perseverance and patience.

Additionally, the friendships I've formed with fellow band members have made rehearsals more enjoyable, and collaborating to perfect performances has strengthened our teamwork. I've learned to step out of my comfort zone and perform with confidence, which has positively impacted other areas of my life as well. Overall, my time in the band has been unforgettable, and I am eager to continue pursuing music in the future.

<h5>ELDDS</h5>

Being in ELDDS since Sec 1 has been an enriching experience. It has allowed me to attend and be a part of many performances over the years, such as watching the ‘I And You’ play by Lauren Gunderson at Gateway Theatre, performing in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and participating in the school’s annual National Day celebration.

What I love the most about ELDDS is that it provides members with the opportunity to for creative expression and collaboration. I also get to participate in games that train me in important theatrical skills, as well as foster camaraderie among my peers. Through ELDDS, I have developed various competencies, such as public speaking, leadership skills, and empathy. As a whole, ELDDS has helped me to improve my intrapersonal and interpersonal skills, as well as allow me to experience and appreciate the beauty of theatre, which has helped me to shape who I am today.

<h5>Festive Drums</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/performing-arts/festive-drums).
    
Being in Festive Drums for the past 3 years has been of my absolute pride, honour, and joy. I can still fondly remember the first day when I stepped foot into this CCA, full of doubts and uncertainty, but all these overwhelming feelings were quickly masked by the warmth and sincerity that my seniors and coach had showered me with. Fast forward 3 years later, I am now a senior, and a leader of this CCA, leading and guiding my juniors the same way my seniors had poured their time, patience and guidance in me.
  
At the end of this journey, I know that I’m not just walking away with my drumming skills, but with the values that this CCA has instilled in me throughout my secondary school life; discipline, respect, and responsibility, which has shaped me into the person I am today. Not to mention, the invaluable friendships which I have forged over the past 3 years that are simply irreplaceable. As the Mandarin saying goes, “a minute on stage takes 10 years of training off-stage”. Being in Festive Drums has helped me appreciate the cultural art performances a little more because I’ve learnt about the hard work that goes on behind the scenes for every performance put up on stage.

Throughout the past 3 years, I've not just grown in my physical strength carrying the drums and doing physical training, but in my mental capacity, and more than that, I've grown as a person; to step out of my comfort zone, to be bold, confident, and to work as a team, to drum with one beat, one voice.

<h5>Guzheng</h5>

For more details, please click&nbsp;[here](https://staging.d3jwf1tlw34213.amplifyapp.com/experience/cca/performing-arts/guzheng).

As the president of the Guzheng Ensemble my journey has been both rewarding and enriching. Leading a group of talented guzheng players has provided me with invaluable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and resilience. One of the most fulfilling aspects of this role has been witnessing our members’ growth, not only in their musical skills but also in their confidence to perform before an audience.

This leadership experience has also underscored the importance of discipline and time management. Balancing my academic responsibilities with CCA commitments has taught me to prioritise tasks and stay organised. Through this, I have gained a deeper appreciation for hard work and perseverance, as our consistent efforts led to improved performances and a stronger sense of unity within the team.

The most memorable moments have been performing together, especially during major events like our annual Open House. The harmony we create as a team reflects not only our musical abilities but also the strong bond we’ve formed over time. As President, I am proud of how far we’ve come and look forward to seeing the continued success of our Guzheng Ensemble in the future.

As the vice president of the Guzheng Ensemble, our journey has been one of growth, learning, and a deepening connection to music. Together, we’ve faced challenges—from mastering difficult pieces to balancing schoolwork with practice—but each obstacle has only strengthened our bond.

Performing at various events, both within school and beyond, has been incredibly rewarding. Each performance reflects hours of dedication, teamwork, and the excitement of bringing beautiful music to life. Along this journey, we’ve grown not just as musicians but as a cohesive team, supporting each other through both successes and setbacks.

Our experience isn’t just about mastering the Guzheng; it’s about sharing our passion for music with others and learning valuable lessons in leadership, discipline, and collaboration. The friendships we’ve built and the skills we’ve gained make this journey truly unforgettable, and we look forward to continuing to grow together.

<h5>Harmonica</h5>

Joining Harmonica CCA has been a transformative journey. At first, we were hesitant to lead or share our ideas, but the supportive environment helped us grow in confidence and step out of our comfort zones. Learning the harmonica opened our eyes to the beauty of different musical genres, and performing as a group brought us closer together. As leaders, we’ve gained valuable skills in guiding others, fostering teamwork, and showing empathy.  These experiences have shaped us into more resilient and confident individuals, with lessons that extend beyond CCA into our daily lives.

CCA has helped me in many different aspects one of them is learning how to communicate well with others. The skill communication have helped me not only become a better person but also help me lead the CCA well. Communication is key in our CCA, without it, we will not be able to get where we are today. Communicating with others also helped me realise that sometimes there is more than just 1 correct answer. We should learn how to put ourselves in other people’s shoes to see where they are coming from. This has also made me realise my dancers strong points and weak points. Some, I believe have great potential to be better and improved. These can be obtained by making effort to understand my dance members and build strong relationship with them. Therefore, having good communication is the most meaningful skill I have acquired through this CCA.

I have learnt how to have self-discipline, relience, collaborating with others as we work together towards a common goal. I personally really love dancing and being able to dance along side my juniors and seniors have never made me happier to attend my CCA! Seeing how everyone works hard together to put up a spectacular performance really fills me with satisfaction. Not only that, I have also learned how to have the self-determination and self-discipline to improve on myself so that i can work even better with my peers!
