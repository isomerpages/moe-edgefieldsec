<p>
<br>From 10 to 14 November 2024, 27 Secondary 2 and 3 students embarked on
a meaningful and eye-opening journey to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, as part of
our school’s Overseas Cultural Immersion Programme. This experience was
designed to nurture cultural agility, deepen intercultural understanding,
and foster a spirit of global friendship.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the programme was a vibrant cultural exchange
at&nbsp;<em>Pras Khan Chey Bokator School</em>, where our students introduced&nbsp;Taekwondo&nbsp;as
a discipline rooted in respect, perseverance, and self-mastery. In return,
they were introduced to the traditional Cambodian martial art of&nbsp;Bokator&nbsp;—
a powerful expression of Cambodia’s heritage and resilience.</p>
<p>This dynamic exchange not only celebrated martial arts, but also built
bridges of mutual curiosity and appreciation between both groups of youths.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of their bicultural learning, students also engaged in school
exchanges with both&nbsp;<em>Chroy Chonya High School</em>, an urban school,
and&nbsp;<em>Thomsras Secondary School</em>, located in a rural village.
Through collaborative games and informal conversations, friendships blossomed
— and meaningful growth unfolded on both sides.&nbsp;Our students took
on leadership roles as they&nbsp;planned and executed bonding activities,
interactive games, and a basic Taekwondo session, creating shared moments
of joy and learning for their Cambodian peers.</p>
<p>These interactions gave Cambodian students the opportunity to practise
their English with confidence, while our students honed cultural agility
and empathy, making new friends while navigating new environments with
openness and heart.</p>
<p>“My favourite memory from the immersion experience was getting to know
my Secondary 3 seniors better and forging deeper bonds with both them and
my level mates. Through our shared experiences, I discovered that I am
capable of stepping out of my comfort zone — to lead, to present, and to
make new friends with confidence. I was especially inspired by the Cambodian
youths, who reminded me to be grateful for even the simplest things in
life, like a warm meal or the presence of newfound friends.”</p>

<p>This immersive experience left an indelible mark on our students, who
returned not only with new friendships and skills, but with a deeper understanding
of themselves and the world. As global citizens, they were reminded that
while languages and customs may differ, the heart of human connection —
mutual respect, curiosity, and kindness — transcends borders.</p>

<p>From 10 to 15 November 2024, our students embarked on an enriching immersion
programme to Guangzhou, China. Hosted by Guangzhou Experiment Secondary
School, they experienced two full days of school immersion—attending lessons,
joining co-curricular activities, and forging friendships with their Chinese
peers. A highlight was staying in the school hostel, where students gained
first-hand experience of the daily routines and lifestyle of their Chinese
counterparts, deepening their understanding of student life in China.</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, students explored China’s blend of tradition and
innovation. They engaged in hands-on cultural activities such as dim sum
making and crafting their own lion dance head, while visits to iFlyTech
and the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City provided insights into
China’s rapid technological advancements and international collaborations.</p>
<p>Through this overseas experience, students not only deepened their appreciation
of China’s rich history and modernisation but also enhanced their 21st
Century Competencies in cross-cultural literacy, adaptive thinking, and
communication. Importantly, the immersion reinforced their sense of belonging
to Singapore and inspired them to think about how innovation and heritage
can shape our nation’s future.</p>
