**Description** <br>
Choir CCA offers students the opportunity to sing different kinds of music. Students get to be around others who share their interest in music. 

Making music with a group of schoolmates will give students just the balance they need between practising alone at home and singing with a group. 

Choir also reinforces the skills of cooperation which are among the qualities most highly valued in school, business and industry. 

It is a group effort which focuses on group goals and the completion of those goals in each and every rehearsal and performance. 

Students will discover how to listen carefully and they will be able to monitor their sound based on how it feels. 

Students are able to work on their ear and social skills. Performance anxiety will also be reduced by singing with a group.
