**Description** <br>
Choir CCA offers students the opportunity to sing different kinds of music. Students get to be around others who share their interest in music.&nbsp;

Making music with a group of schoolmates will give students just the balance they need between practising alone at home and singing with a group.&nbsp;

Choir also reinforces the skills of cooperation which are among the qualities most highly valued in school, business and industry.&nbsp;

It is a group effort which focuses on group goals and the completion of those goals in each and every rehearsal and performance.&nbsp;

Students will discover how to listen carefully and they will be able to monitor their sound based on how it feels.&nbsp;

Students are able to work on their ear and social skills. Performance anxiety will also be reduced by singing with a group.
