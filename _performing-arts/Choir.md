**Description** <br>

Choir CCA offers students the opportunity to explore their interest in singing while building essential life skills. Through regular rehearsals and performances, students develop focus, discipline, and teamwork—growing both in skill and character, in line with our mission of Growing Minds, Glowing Hearts.&nbsp;

By making music together, students learn to listen attentively, cooperate closely, and work toward shared goals. The experience fosters compassion as they support one another during practices and performances, and courage as they gradually build the confidence to perform on stage and express themselves with authenticity.&nbsp;

Beyond vocal training, the CCA nurtures social awareness, emotional resilience, and a sense of belonging—preparing students for future challenges in and beyond school.
