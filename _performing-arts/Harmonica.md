**Description** <br>
The Edgefield Harmonica Ensemble was established in 2012 to allow students with little or no musical background in music to enjoy, appreciate and develop an intrinsic love for music. Through regular practice and dedication, our members develop into Collaborative Innovators who work together to create unique musical experiences while honing their skills in presenting quality music.

Under the coaching of Ms He Hui Teng, conductor of Spresso Harmonica Ensemble, Edgefield Harmonica Ensemble strives to reach greater heights in musical expression and appreciation. Our members explore various instruments beyond the traditional chromatic, tenor, chord and bass harmonica, incorporating bass guitar, keyboard and cajon to create rich repertoires ranging from classical pieces to popular music and movie soundtracks.

Beyond musical excellence, our members grow as Compassionate Leaders through active community engagement such as public performances to commemorate meaningful events. Through such performances, students grow their confidence and make a positive impact in our community.
