**Description** <br>
ELDDS is a young and vibrant Co-Curricular Activity that hopes to cultivate an innovative, creative and performing mind that relishes challenges and thrives in innovation and the performing arts. ELDDS offers a way to perceive and interact with the world in a deeply critical and philosophical manner. Not only does it teach the value of teamwork (which is what stage performances must rely upon), it also inculcates more intrinsic values such as discipline, resilience and perseverance. Participating in the ELDDS does not only require “dramatic” students, we welcome all students interested in the performing arts. Any student wishing to learn the intricacies of production and backstage management as well as acting and performing on stage is welcome to learn, grow and develop as a thespian, stage manager and production crew.
