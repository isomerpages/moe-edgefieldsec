**Description** <br>
The Guzheng Ensemble nurtures a love for traditional Chinese music while cultivating character and values in our students. Through the rich, expressive sounds of the guzheng, members learn the importance of sincerity â€” to practise with dedication, to perform with authenticity, and to stay true to the spirit of the music.

In every rehearsal and performance, students uphold honour by showing respect to their instrument, their peers, and the cultural heritage they represent. They take pride in working together harmoniously, striving for excellence as individuals and as an ensemble.

Beyond musical skill, the Guzheng Ensemble develops resilience, discipline, and teamwork, providing students with a meaningful platform to grow as musicians and as individuals of integrity.
