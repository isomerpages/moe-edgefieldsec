**Description** <br>
The SYFC aims to be a CCA of a world class standard, cultivating students who have a passion for flying and to compete internationally too.

SYFC was implemented in 2001 as a CCA in secondary schools to enable younger students, those aged between 12 and 16 years old, to learn more about flying through aviation knowledge, simulator flying and aeromodelling activities.

EFSS SYFC started as an open unit for interested students in 2012. The CCA started officially in 2013 recruiting the first batch of members. Ever since, the club has grown to a total of 50 members.
