**Description** <br>
Art Club offers students with interest in visual arts to come together and learn about art.  

Art Club creates a platform for students to showcase their talents and expand their knowledge in art and art-making through the use of different mediums. Students will be exposed to different craft types such as painting, illustration, digital art, sculpture, printmaking, etc.  

Learning opportunities are also provided for students to embark on visits to museums to view art exhibitions. Such visits will help them build appreciation and awareness of art around them.
