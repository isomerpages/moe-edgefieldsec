**Description** <br>
The Edgefield Robotics Club is “Where Creativity Meets Technology”. It offers students a dynamic space to explore innovation through hands-on problem-solving. Members design, build, and program robots using LEGO MINDSTORM EV3 and LEGO SPIKE PRIME and also gain experience in drone programming and flight.

Through engaging projects and competitions, students learn to persevere through challenges, adapt their ideas, and collaborate closely with peers. Along the way, they develop confidence, initiative, and the ability to communicate their ideas effectively.

Beyond building robots, the club equips students with future-ready skills — from inventive thinking and teamwork to digital fluency and resilience. These experiences prepare them not only for competitions but also for the evolving world of technology, innovation, and meaningful contributions to society.

The Edgefield Robotics Club is where students discover their potential as innovators, leaders, and team players—ready to embrace the opportunities and challenges of the future.
