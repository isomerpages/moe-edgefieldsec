**Description** <br>
Our students learn the basics of building and programming miniature robots using LEGO MINDSTORM EV3 under the instructions of a capable robotics trainer. Other exposure and curriculums included programming and operating drones. Students who have the potential to excel will be selected to take part in national competitions and will undergo further intensive training so that they can achieve excellence during the national competitions.

Edgefield Robotics Club strives to empower our students to have the passion to excel in building and programming miniature robots to take part in national competitions. With these activities in place, our students will be able to develop team spirit, leadership skills and event organizing skills.
