**Description** <br>
The Entrepreneur Club (E-Club) guides its members how to be responsible, committed and creative in their decision-making for the CCA. Students each undergo unique and hands-on experiences.&nbsp;

Students will learn basic business skills such as accounting, financial planning, business proposal writing, business presentation, making a sales pitch and business marketing. Professional trainers are also engaged to run workshops and courses, sharing invaluable experiences that add value to students' learning.

The E-Club teaches its students the reality of business management, of the struggles and joys it holds. Here, students are completely independent, and have to learn how to run a shop on their own, organise and operate ad-hoc sales on push-carts in the school compound. With guidance from their seniors, students achieve crucial business practices, such as stock taking, how to use a cash register and other relevant skills.
