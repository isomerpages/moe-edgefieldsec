<p><strong>Description</strong> 
<br>Wushu CCA: Cultivating Character, Perseverance and Respect</p>
<p>At Edgefield Secondary School, the Wushu Co-Curricular Activity (CCA)
is more than just a sport - it is a journey of personal growth, discipline,
and teamwork. Rooted in tradition yet evolving with modern elements, Wushu
develops not only physical agility and strength but also character, perseverance,
and respect.</p>
<p>Aligned with the school’s vision of Collaborative Innovators, Compassionate
Leaders, the Wushu members train rigorously, refining their techniques
while fostering teamwork and mutual support. Through dedicated practice
and competitions, they cultivate perseverance, adaptability, and confidence,
equipping them to face challenges with courage.</p>
<p>In line with the school’s mission of Growing Minds, Glowing Hearts, Wushu
CCA nurtures self-directed athletes who take ownership of their progress,
demonstrating resilience in the face of setbacks. Beyond mastering martial
arts techniques, our students develop social-emotional skills, learning
perseverance, self-discipline, and respect - values that extend beyond
the practice arena into their daily lives.</p>
<p>In upholding the school’s motto, Sincerity and Honour, and core values
of Moral Courage and Compassion, Wushu CCA cultivates students who demonstrate
sportsmanship, perseverance, and empathy. Whether competing at National
School Games, performing in school events or mentoring younger peers, the
Wushu members exemplify excellence in both mind and heart, ready to thrive
in school and beyond.</p>
