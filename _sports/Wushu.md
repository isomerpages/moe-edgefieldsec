**Description** <br>
Wushu offers students many fitness benefits, such as improvements in strength, flexibility, balance, stamina and body awareness. The sports also emphasize on the temperament and mental attitude aspects which helps the students to gow into a more self-disciplined, resilient and confident individual.

The trainings are designed to nurture studentsâ€™ moral values and mental toughness through innovative and interactive routines. Occasional students' led team-building and VIA activities provide a platform for them to showcase and explore further interests and strengths beyond Wushu.
