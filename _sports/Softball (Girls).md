**Description** <br>
Softball CCA hopes to cultivate a “Respectful Mind” and “Disciplined Mind” in the students through the learning of Softball. Softball is a team sport which helps develop hand-eye coordination and mental focus. Other than developing physical strength and motor skills such as throwing, catching and batting, development of game concepts and safety awareness are also pivotal. Emphasis is also placed in the cultivation of desirable values such as resilience, discipline, respect and teamwork through the sport.
