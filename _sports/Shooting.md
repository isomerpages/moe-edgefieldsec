**Description** <br>
Shooting is a CCA that requires mental toughness, strong upper body and core strength. During the CCA sessions, shooters develop values of discipline and focus through tough trainings to prepare them for local competitions. Shooters also practice sports psychological skills such as relaxation techniques, concentration techniques and performance routines. These essential skills help shooters to perform at the optimum level during competitions.

Shooting CCA hopes to cultivate a “Disciplined Mind” in the students through the learning of proper shooting techniques and training.
