Work with school management to deepen the scope of collaboration. 

Building and maintaining closer relationships with all Edgefield parents and PSG members. 

Act as a feedback channel for parents to communicate with the school.

### Message from EFSS PSG Executive Committee (EFSS PSG EXCO)
  
Dear Parents,

A warm welcome to Edgefield Secondary School!  

EFSS PSG started out in 2014 when the school first took its baby steps to become what it is today. <br> We strongly believe that parents' involvement in their child's growing years by building a strong parent-child relationship, is a significant factor in a child's emotional and cognitive development.

Here is a look at how the PSG partners with the school:

1) Organise talks on various parenting issues,
2) Participate in bonding activities for our children,
3) Organise festive activities in school to create more awareness on the different cultures and their importance,
4) Participate in other school initiatives and/or collaborations.

We welcome you and/or your spouse to join our PSG family and volunteer your time and expertise!

Looking forward to another great year with the PSG community!
