Dear Parents,

A warm welcome to Edgefield Secondary School!

Here is a look at how the PSG partners with the school:

1) Organise talks on various parenting issues,
2) Participates in bonding activities for our children,
3) Hosts festive activities to raise awareness of different cultures and their significance,
4) Engages in other school initiatives and/or collaborations.

We warmly invite you and your spouse to join our PSG family! Experience the fun, connect with fellow parents and your child, and share your time and expertise through volunteering.
