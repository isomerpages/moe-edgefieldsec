As a beginning teacher, I count myself very fortunate to have been posted to Edgefield Secondary School fresh out of my teacher qualification training at the National Institute of Education. In the short year and a half that I have been here, I have learned a great deal from my colleagues and students whom I have had the privilege of interacting with.
    
The staff here at Edgefield Secondary School live out the ethos of the teaching profession. I am constantly awed by the high standards my colleagues set for themselves and the many sacrifices they willing make for the sake of the students. It is not uncommon for teachers to spend their pockets of free time chatting with students to ensure that they have the best learning environments in school or painstakingly curating the best resources to create a thoughtful lesson for students. Through their guidance, I have come to better appreciate the hard work that goes into the heart of teaching. I am inspired daily to also give my best for my own students and rest in the assurance and confidence that we are all working towards the same goal of educating our future leaders.

My wife and I welcomed our 2nd child in my first year in this school. Amidst all the bustle of my duties as a Dad, I managed to fulfil my many other responsibilities as a teacher too. I was given a lot of space to pursue my interests and contribute meaningfully to the school.  I found many like- minded colleagues who shared the same passions and formed positive synergies which allowed us to value add the school experience both for teachers and students. Year by year, the school has been gaining momentum in our programs and it is heartwarming to see students really step up and do the school proud. With timely support from the school management and backed by an efficient school admin team, I really feel energised thinking and planning for the year to come. 
    
As I watch my own children grow I am happy to be part of the growing Edgefield community. Today we see more and more of our alumni coming back eager to serve and through the Uniformed Groups we are working on platforms for them to develop unique identities and cultures within the various CCAs. It is refreshing to be part of a “young school” which is vibrant and forward thinking.

As I reflect on my journey at Edgefield thus far, the one experience that flashed in my mind was when I attended the Apple training in Orchard, as part of our Humanities department meeting. We were treated to a hands-on session on the ‘Procreate’ software.
    
I was engaged throughout the three hours that we spent there, lost in a new world of dimension, space, and perspective. The experience connected me to a time way back in the past when Art was a leisurely activity I occasionally indulged in but was intercepted along the way as ‘life’ took precedence. It made me realise that all is not lost. There is time yet to develop my hitherto unexplored potential. At this juncture, though, allow me to emphasise that the word indulgence does not necessarily equate with proficiency.
    
Needless to say, it was a Humanities meeting like no other. I left the place in high spirits, with my mind opened to new possibilities.
    
I hope that Edgefield can create more of such experiences to enable us not just to bond with fellow colleagues, but also to learn new skills that we would ordinarily not have the time to do so on our own.
