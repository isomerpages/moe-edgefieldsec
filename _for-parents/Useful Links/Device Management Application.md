<h3><strong>Device Management Application</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Device Management Application Installation</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your child’s/ward’s PLD will be installed with a Device Management Application
(DMA) to provide a safer digital environment for learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installation of the DMA will be performed after the collection of the
device. Students will be guided on the installation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This applies to both devices purchased through the school and pre-existing
student-owned devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DMA will be funded by MOE and will be uninstalled from the device
when your child/ward graduates/leaves the school.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In-School DMA Settings (Default)</strong>
<br>Schools will determine DMA settings for in-school use. As a default, these
settings will continue to be in place after school as well:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>MOE and the school will set the level of web content filtering, including
filtering objectionable content or content that may not be conducive to
teaching and learning (e.g. social media, pornography, gambling, or websites
containing extremist content)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students will be able to use the device from 06.30 a.m. to 11.00 p.m.
daily</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school will determine the apps and programs to be installed to support
teaching and learning</p>
</li>

<p>Parents/guardians can request to change their choice of DMA settings at

<p><strong>Deciding on the Choice of After-School DMA Option</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents/guardians may wish to consider the following questions before
deciding on the choice of after-school DMA option which is best for your
child’s/ward’s learning.</p>
<p><strong>Child’s/ward’s current device usage habits</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How much time does my child/ward spend on their device?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How well is my child/ward able to regula​​te their device usage on their
own?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does my child/ward get easily distracted while doing online learning?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parents’/Guardians’ involvement</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>How confident and familiar am I with managing my child’s/ward’s cyber
wellness?</p>

<p>Are there existing routines and open conversations on the use of the Internet
at home?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am I aware of how to prevent different types of cyber threats that my
