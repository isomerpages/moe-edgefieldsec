_“I enjoy learning and studying because I don’t feel intimidated in my form class even though I know there are classmates from the different courses of study. I feel more confident when speaking to others and it’s a lot easier to make friends! I felt motivated to volunteer in the Lunar New Year Hamper distribution to needy families in our Punggol community. Working together with my classmates and students from other classes was a really fun and meaningful experience.”_

_“I enjoy Literature and Geography lessons and the activities being planned! It is fun and interesting as I could learn more things. The class is really disciplined and focused which I really like as everyone can listen to the teacher properly and pay attention in class. We can help each other and guide each other better since we have different strengths. It is fun as we can learn new things and at a more demanding level. In addition, we can set higher standards and goals for ourselves.”_

### Edgefield Secondary School is one of the 28 secondary schools selected by the Ministry of Education to start piloting aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2020 onwards.

**Purpose of Full SBB** <br>
With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs, without labels. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life in them.

By 2021, the pilot schools will have fully implemented the following aspects of Full SBB:

* Organising Secondary 1 form classes in new ways; or
* Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2.
