VIA@Community gives Year 2 students the chance to develop the skill of running a fundraising campaign for a class-chosen beneficiary organisation through the giving.sg website. Students undergo site visits to better understand how global challenges are contextualised in a local community setting before they conduct the fundraising campaign.

**Student Reflections** <br>
_Ramesh Dharun, 2EU_  <br>
"I managed to do research that was needed to tell people what the fundraiser was about. I had done research about ACRES and what they do. This also helped me interact with other group members and improved my research skills. The project was a good one overall and I managed to contribute well."
