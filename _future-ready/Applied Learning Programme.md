The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) of the school, G.E.M "Growing the Edgefield Mindset"&nbsp;programme aims to develop Edgefielders with capabilities that prepare them for the future in view of rapid global changes.&nbsp;  
  
From honing skills and competencies in critical and inventive thinking skills, collaborative skills, to advanced life skills such as alertness-to-opportunity, to bouncing back from failures, G.E.M equips our students with advanced problem-solving skills to become Entre/Intrapreneur in line with the school’s vision of nurturing “Collaborative Innovators, Compassionate Leaders”.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
The G.E.M programme has been thoughtfully designed after taking into consideration the insights and perspectives of future trends taken from both global and local sources of intelligence such as the Strategy Group in the Prime Minister's Office, World Economic Forum, and Institute of Policy Studies (Singapore).

### Future Ready Programme&nbsp;  

An earthquake hits. Mayhem breaks out. There is news of missing people who might be trapped somewhere. They have 8 minutes to evacuate or they may not survive. Edgefield’s search team immediately gets to work to survey the surroundings and locate the victims. But how is the small team going to search 8000 square metres within that short span of time? By programming and deploying drones! The drones will give them an aerial perspective of the situation and help them observe signs of human life as well as obtain critical information to direct the rescue team to the right locations.&nbsp;

This exciting simulation is part of Edgefield’s thoughtfully crafted Future Ready ProgrammeTM&nbsp; (FRP) to prepare students for the future.

That’s not all. Other scenarios include commissioning a task force to tackle nationwide food scarcity and water shortage through urban farming and water harvesting methods, setting up an innovative social experiment to enable Singaporeans to experience the impact of a diverse society and building a physical model of a floating city which can be implemented in the event of critical sea levels.&nbsp;

These are but a few examples of the FRP which ensures that our students are equipped with key skills of the future, such as complex problem solving, critical thinking and creativity (Future of Jobs report, OECD) and keep pace with future developments through a series of keystone programmes. Students have opportunities to see the relevance of the skills they have acquired through various platforms, such as the MOE Innovation Programme (MOE IvP), SIT Community Challenge, Future Skills Day and Future Problem Solving Programme (FPSP). FPSP is an international competition where students apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills to hypothetical future situations. Edgefield’s Future Ready Programme looks at current technological, geo-political, and societal trends and projects those trends 20 to 30 years into the future, training students to develop solutions to the challenges they may face as adults.&nbsp;

Besides being ‘exam-smart’ and ‘book-smart’, an Edgefielder is also ‘street-smart’ and world-ready.

### ARTasFEST 2023

ARTasFEST 2023 is a vibrant, student-led platform at Edgefield Secondary School. It enhances 21st Century Competencies and underlines the significance of student-led initiatives. Held once every two years, this unique event is a fusion of a school carnival and a live outdoor concert, showcasing the talents and creativity of our students and alumni.

ARTasFEST 2023 was held on Aug 11, 2023. The event featured a variety of food stalls, student-led game booths, live performances, and collaborations with local entrepreneurs. Each class was tasked with planning, organising, and operating a booth, providing students with an opportunity to develop their leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. 

Themed "Together We Strive, Together We Thrive," ARTasFEST 2023 represents a unifying and collaborative effort at Edgefield Secondary School. There is also an added significance to the theme as the event provides a platform for Edgefield students and alumni to reconnect after years of physical separation due to the pandemic.

What makes ARTasFEST unique is its affordability and inclusivity. It's a school-based carnival that brings the Punggol community together. This year, the event signified our dedication to giving back to the community through an enjoyable and cost-effective celebration. As the sun sets, ARTasFEST comes alive with vibrant neon lights, symbolizing our school's heart for the community.

The event goes beyond being just a carnival; it's a celebration of shared values and unity. ARTasFEST is an embodiment of the spirit of togetherness and resilience, showcasing the collective strength of Edgefielders in striving for a brighter future.
