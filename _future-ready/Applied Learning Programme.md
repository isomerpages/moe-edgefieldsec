The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) of the school, G.E.M "Growing the Edgefield Mindset" programme aims to develop Edgefielders with capabilities that prepare them for the future in view of rapid global changes.   
  
From honing skills and competencies in critical and inventive thinking skills, collaborative skills, to advanced life skills such as alertness-to-opportunity, to bouncing back from failures, G.E.M equips our students with advanced problem-solving skills to become Entre/Intrapreneur in line with the school’s vision of nurturing “Collaborative Innovators, Compassionate Leaders”.     
  
The G.E.M programme has been thoughtfully designed after taking into consideration the insights and perspectives of future trends taken from both global and local sources of intelligence such as the World Economic Forum and Institute of Policy Studies (Singapore).

### Future Ready Programme   

An earthquake hits. Mayhem breaks out. There is news of missing people who might be trapped somewhere. They have 8 minutes to evacuate or they may not survive. Edgefield’s search team immediately gets to work to survey the surroundings and locate the victims. But how is the small team going to search 8000 square metres within that short span of time? By programming and deploying drones! The drones will give them an aerial perspective of the situation and help them observe signs of human life as well as obtain critical information to direct the rescue team to the right locations. 

This exciting simulation is part of Edgefield’s thoughtfully crafted Future Ready ProgrammeTM  (FRP) to prepare students for the future.

That’s not all. Other scenarios include commissioning a task force to tackle nationwide food scarcity and water shortage through urban farming and water harvesting methods, setting up an innovative social experiment to enable Singaporeans to experience the impact of a diverse society and building a physical model of a floating city which can be implemented in the event of critical sea levels. 

These are but a few examples of the FRP which ensures that our students are equipped with key skills of the future, such as complex problem solving, critical thinking and creativity (Future of Jobs report, OECD) and keep pace with future developments through a series of keystone programmes. Students have opportunities to see the relevance of the skills they have acquired through various platforms, such as the Future Skills Day and Future Problem Solving Programme (FPSP). FPSP is an international competition where students apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills to hypothetical future situations. Edgefield’s Future Ready Programme looks at current technological, geo-political, and societal trends and projects those trends 20 to 30 years into the future, training students to develop solutions to the challenges they may face as adults. 

Besides being ‘exam-smart’ and ‘book-smart’, an Edgefielder is also ‘street-smart’ and world-ready.
