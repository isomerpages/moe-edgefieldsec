<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) of the school, G.E.M "Growing the
Edgefield Mindset"&nbsp;programme aims to develop Edgefielders with capabilities
that prepare them for the future in view of rapid global changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From honing skills and competencies in critical and inventive thinking
skills, collaborative skills, to advanced life skills such as alertness-to-opportunity,
to bouncing back from failures, G.E.M equips our students with advanced
problem-solving skills to become Entre/Intrapreneur in line with the school’s
vision of nurturing “Collaborative Innovators, Compassionate Leaders”.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thoughtful design of the G.E.M. programme draws upon the insights
and perspectives of future trends taken from both local and global sources
of intelligence, including the Strategy Group in the Prime Minister's Office,
World Economic Forum, and Institute of Policy Studies (Singapore).</p>

<h3>Future Ready Programme&nbsp;</h3>
<p>An earthquake hits. Mayhem breaks out. There is news of missing people
who might be trapped somewhere. They have 8 minutes to evacuate or they
may not survive. Edgefield’s search team immediately gets to work to survey
the surroundings and locate the victims. But how is the small team going
to search 8000 square metres within that short span of time? By programming
and deploying drones! The drones will give them an aerial perspective of
the situation and help them observe signs of human life as well as obtain
critical information to direct the rescue team to the right locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This exciting simulation is part of Edgefield’s thoughtfully crafted Future
Ready ProgrammeTM&nbsp; (FRP) to prepare students for the future.</p>
<p>That’s not all. Other scenarios include commissioning a task force to
tackle nationwide food scarcity and water shortage through urban farming
and water harvesting methods, setting up an innovative social experiment
to enable Singaporeans to experience the impact of a diverse society and
building a physical model of a floating city which can be implemented in
the event of critical sea levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are but a few examples of the FRP which ensures that our students
are equipped with key skills of the future, such as complex problem solving,
critical thinking and creativity (Future of Jobs report, OECD) and keep
pace with future developments through a series of keystone programmes.
Students have opportunities to see the relevance of the skills they have
acquired through various platforms, such as the MOE Innovation Programme
(MOE IvP), SIT Community Challenge, Future Skills Day and Future Problem
Solving Programme (FPSP). FPSP is an international competition where students
apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills to hypothetical future
situations. Edgefield’s Future Ready Programme looks at current technological,
geo-political, and societal trends and projects those trends 20 to 30 years
into the future, training students to develop solutions to the challenges
they may face as adults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides being ‘exam-smart’ and ‘book-smart’, an Edgefielder is also ‘street-smart’
and world-ready.</p>

<h3>Growing the Edgefield Mindset</h3>
<p>Are there skills you think you can never pick up in school? Well, maybe
not at Edgefield!</p>
<p>From honing skills and competencies in business management and marketing,
to advanced life skills such as alertness-to-opportunity and bouncing back
from failures, Edgefield’s Applied Learning Programme, “Growing the Edgefield&nbsp;
Mindset” (G.E.M), equips you with advanced problem-solving skills to become
an Entre/Intrapreneur! Put the skills and competencies developed through
the Future Ready Programme to good use, solving real-world problems and
benefiting the community using a multi disciplinary approach. For example,
learn about the challenges faced by the visually impaired during an FRP
learning journey, draw inspiration, and use the Content Creator and Game
Design modules to produce engaging videos and exciting games. Bring it
all together in a fundraising campaign that raises awareness and generates
support for the visually impaired!</p>
<p></p>
<p>G.E.M culminates in ARTasFEST, a milestone carnival attracting more than
5000 participants! Design your own Escape Room, collaborate with entrepreneurs,
run your own pop-up store, concoct your favourite drinks, host Instagram
marketing campaigns, acquire deep learning and then find yourself suffering
from ARTasFEST withdrawal symptoms!</p>

<h3>ARTasFEST 2023</h3>
<p>ARTasFEST 2023 is a vibrant, student-led platform at Edgefield Secondary
School. It enhances 21st Century Competencies and underlines the significance
of student-led initiatives. Held once every two years, this unique event
is a fusion of a school carnival and a live outdoor concert, showcasing
the talents and creativity of our students and alumni.</p>
<p>ARTasFEST 2023 was held on Aug 11, 2023. The event featured a variety
of food stalls, student-led game booths, live performances, and collaborations
with local entrepreneurs. Each class was tasked with planning, organising,
and operating a booth, providing students with an opportunity to develop
their leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Themed "Together We Strive, Together We Thrive," ARTasFEST 2023 represents
a unifying and collaborative effort at Edgefield Secondary School. There
is also an added significance to the theme as the event provides a platform
for Edgefield students and alumni to reconnect after years of physical
separation due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>What makes ARTasFEST unique is its affordability and inclusivity. It's
a school-based carnival that brings the Punggol community together. This
year, the event signified our dedication to giving back to the community
through an enjoyable and cost-effective celebration. As the sun sets, ARTasFEST
comes alive with vibrant neon lights, symbolizing our school's heart for
the community.</p>
<p>The event goes beyond being just a carnival; it's a celebration of shared
values and unity. ARTasFEST is an embodiment of the spirit of togetherness
and resilience, showcasing the collective strength of Edgefielders in striving
for a brighter future.</p>
