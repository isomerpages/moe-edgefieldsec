The VUCA World of tomorrow is one that is characterised by various contentious issues, and differences across groups of people are becoming increasingly polarised. The leaders of tomorrow will possess qualities different from those of today. Compassion and Empathy are what set great leaders apart.  

Edgefield Secondary School believes in nurturing Compassionate Leaders who will Lead, Care and Inspire. Building on the strong fundamentals of The Leadership Challenge Model, the Edgefield student leadership programme is aligned to the Desired Outcomes of the 21st Century Competencies Framework, and committed to developing values-centric leaders who are grounded in the school values.

The IDEAR approach is used in the development of leadership skills in Edgefield students:  
  
(I)dentify: All students to identify their personal strengths, areas of improvement and leadership styles.  
(D)evelopment &amp; (E)xposure: Provision of platform and leadership opportunities for students to hone their leadership skills.  
(A)chievement &amp; (R)ecognition: To provide avenues to recognise students’ personal leadership growth and development as an individual.  
  
The school is committed to developing individuals grounded in strong values such as Compassion, Moral Courage, Sincerity and Honour, and who actively contribute to the community. This is achieved through the provision of level wide leadership modules and Values-In-Action platforms, equipping students with the soft skills to achieve self and peer leadership.  
  
Student leaders also learn about building a positive culture through the Appreciative Inquiry approach, the 4D process of ‘Discover, Dream, Design, Deliver’.
