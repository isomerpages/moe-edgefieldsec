At Edgefield Secondary, we are intentional in the design of our curriculum in preparing our children to be ‘future-ready’. Learning experiences center on thinking and learning independently and also develop our children’s 21st&nbsp;century competencies.

Technology has transformed our lives, evident from how our work and social environments have changed. In tomorrow’s age where emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are set to take over many functions and roles controlled by humans today, we must enable our children to harness the capabilities of technology and embrace new opportunities ahead.

To do this, they have to start young, and start right.

Edgefield Secondary’s Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) Programme is designed to meet these needs. Our goal is “Quality Learning in the Hands of Every Learner Empowered with Technology”. While our Apple Education Programme equips every student with new media production skills, our 1:1 personalised learning through iPads integrates thinking and learning across our total curriculum, enhancing the learning experience. Digital Sketchnoting makes thinking visible, enabling students to explore and develop ideas, and combines with cloud technology to enable learning anytime, anywhere. Co-construction of knowledge and internet research amplifies and deepens learning, while collaborative apps allow exploration of alternative perspectives and diverse views. This enables metacognitive learning to take place. Through the affordances of technology, learning becomes dynamic and personalised.

### Our Journey on 1:1 Personalised Learning

### Our Pedagogical Approach

**Active Learning Processes**  
Teachers infuse active learning processes as they craft learning experiences to engage students as active participants through these steps:
<ul>Activate Learning</ul>  
<ul> Promote Thinking and Discussion  </ul>
<ul> Facilitate Demonstration of Learning </ul>
<ul> Monitor and Provide Feedback </ul>
  
**Replacement-Amplification-Transformation Model**  
The Replacement-Amplification-Transformation model guides teachers to assess how they use technology to impact their teaching practices.&nbsp;This strengthens teachers’ quality of technology integration in their classroom practice by enabling them to think deeply about the role of technology in supporting students’ learning. The levels of technology used will differ in terms of the purpose and complexity of integrating technology into teaching.  
  
**Differentiated Instruction**  
Teachers employ Differentiated Instruction and consider students’ learning preferences and levels of readiness, before designing a lesson. Teachers scaffold students’ learning and stretch their zone of proximal development, thereby encouraging and advancing their individual learning.

### Digital Literacy Programme

Our **Digital Literacy Programme** equips all Secondary One students with essential digital skills, including filming and video editing, empowering them to become content creators and share their insights with the world.  
  
Students also explore their creativity through tools like **Canva**, where they map out the ‘low and high points’ of their Edgefield journey to present to their parents during the Student-Led Conference.  
  
With elective modules like ‘Coding using Swift Playgrounds’, students can dive into their interests while learning the language of the future.
