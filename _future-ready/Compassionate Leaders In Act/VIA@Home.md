VIA@Home gives Year 1 students the opportunity to develop empathy for their family members. Through empathy mapping, students consider their family’s needs through the perspective of a family member of their choice. Students are then encouraged to pledge some time to meet those identified needs.

**Student Reflections** <br>
_Lok Yong Ming, 1EV 2022_  <br>
“The empathy map made me **realise that I don't know that much about how my mother views things**. I used to think that I knew my family's views on different things very well but now I know that I don't."

_Achyut Pradhan, 1EM 2022_ <br>
“This project has really given me an opportunity to go off the beaten track and try something new for once, all the while **helping me view my family from a different perspective**.”

_Janet Lee, 1EL 2022_ <br>
“I managed to help my mother with more chores through this project. **I was happy with my progress as my mother really did appreciate it**, though I could have done more if I did have some extra time.”
