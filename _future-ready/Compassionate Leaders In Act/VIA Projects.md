"The Year 3 VIA Projects give students the chance to work with like-minded peers in making a positive impact on a beneficiary that they have chosen and have conducted research on. To date, our students have engaged with a wide range of beneficiary organisations including St Luke’s ElderCare, ACRES, Beyond Social Services and Punggol West Residents’ Network.

**Student Reflection**  <br>
_Jedi Ang, 3EC_ <br>
_"We **truly felt like we were helping people** and **not doing it for the sake of doing it** while putting the action plan together. While doing it, **we felt better as we knew that what we were doing was really helping the people with autism**."_

_Shah Dubies, 3EH_  <br>
_"It was a **rewarding experience to engage and interact with the elderly**. Even though we were quite new to the experience, the seniors were supportive and cheerful throughout the session which really helped elevate the atmosphere."_
