_"This programme has made me curious about how I can tackle the issues we face in the real world, to make life better for everyone else. In light of COVID-19, my group and I still managed to have virtual discussions and although we had to manage the challenges of staying home and not meeting physically, we managed to complete the project successfully. I felt that the group was creative and adaptable even as we faced different challenges. I am now keener to learn about how we can make our solution a permanent one and how we can continue to improve on our solution. My team and I should continue to ensure that our solution is effective even if the project is already over. I am looking forward to more of such experiences in the future."_

_"My confidence and communication skills have been further developed through this programme. I have learnt how to work with different types of people. Normally if I were able to choose my group, I would choose my close friends because it would be easier for me to share my thoughts. However, for this project, I had to work with different teammates and had to learn how to be comfortable around them and share my ideas. The COVID-19 situation was a challenge to overcome. We could no longer meet up with each other to discuss and it made it harder to communicate at first. After some time, we got used to it and I found it easier because I could processs my thoughts in a more relaxed way which led me to better solutions. Now, I can use this new skill when I meet new people even outside of school. The Future Ready Programme also made me curious about what I can do to help the world change for the better. Not everyone has to do something big like starting an organisation. Small efforts are just as important. I can educate people whom I know. My learning can definitely help me in the future for other projects or even in my future career."_
