<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Direct School Admission for junior colleges (DSA-JC) allows students to
apply to a DSA school before taking the GCE O-Level examinations. Students
can apply based on talent in sports, CCAs and specific academic areas that
may not be demonstrated at the O-Level examinations. Link: <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/dsa" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/dsa</a>
