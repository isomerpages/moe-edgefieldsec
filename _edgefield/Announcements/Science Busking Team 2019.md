### Edgefield Secondary's Science Busking Team in the Top 47!

**Our Science busking team has made it to top 47 to compete in the Science Busking Finals 2019!**  
  
There were around 700+ teams competing this year, and we are one of the 18 secondary schools who made it! This year, we have worked very hard and after many trials, managed to master the craft of "bending water backwards"! The girls are giving their best and hope to represent the school well for the finals this year! 
  
The team comprises:  
Crystal Lim Pei Yi (2EV) <br>
Lin Ying Xi (2EV) <br>
