**Start:** 2018-12-31 

**Description:** <br>
In conjunction with the Singapore Kindness Movement, and also to build a spirit of Compassionate Leadership in the school community, our students have done up these beautiful pledge boards where they individually penned down pledges to show care towards others. We want to encourage all staff and students to continue these kind acts!

Let’s remember that no act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted!
