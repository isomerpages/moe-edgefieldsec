**Description:** <br>
The Singapore International Band Festival (SIBF) was held yesterday, 27 July and we would like to congratulate our Concert Band members for obtaining the bronze award!

SIBF is a biennial festival that was started in 2008 by the Wind Bands Association of Singapore. Since 2008, SIBF has built a reputation as an international stage in Asia that provides developmental opportunity for bands and upholds high artistic integrity in its adjudication.

Through SIBF, bands from all over the world will be brought together in Singapore for an exchange of musical ideas and ideals, where musicians of all ages would be encouraged to continuously learn and strive towards excellence at their own pace.
