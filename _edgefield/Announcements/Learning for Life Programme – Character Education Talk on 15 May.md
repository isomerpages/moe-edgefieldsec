A Character Education talk was conducted on the 15 May. With the support of SportSG, we are happy to have our national basketball player, Ng Hanbin, to speak to the school about resilience and excellence.

His speech captivated the hearts and minds of the students and has motivated them to strive for excellence and never give up.
