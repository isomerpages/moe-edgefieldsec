Four of our students: Teffania (4EV), Joshua Lai (4EV), Chia Hui Jing (3EC) and Xing Zengbao (3EC), took part in the 20th International Elementz Science Research Conference and Exhibition held from 8th to 11th April 2019.  
  
They worked and presented on a project to study the effect of solar concentration in improving the efficiency of solar cells for applications in water splitting. Under the supervision and guidance from their teacher mentors Dr Bernard Ng and Mr Seow Tzer Yuen, we are proud to announce that the team has been awarded a Certificate of Commendation for their project!  
  
Well done to the team and teachers!
