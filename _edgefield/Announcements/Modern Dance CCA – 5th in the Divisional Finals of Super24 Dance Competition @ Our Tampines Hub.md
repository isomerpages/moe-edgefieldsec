**Description:** <br>
Super 24 is a dance showcase competition to showcase dance talents and team unity. It emphasizes teamwork and ingenuity. Teams are to consist of exactly 24 members, dancing within a confined 8 by 8 metre square and performing a strictly 90-second routine.

Our school was the 5th team in the divisional finals for the Secondary School Category and was awarded the “Golden Ticket” to proceed to the finals on the 4 August @ OCBC Arena. The team consists of Sec 1s to 3s dancers and they are thrilled to be in the finals.
