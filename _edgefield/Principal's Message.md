At Edgefield Secondary School, we are a community built on care, trust, and a shared belief in the potential of every student. It is a privilege to lead a school that embraces learning beyond the classroom and fosters a nurturing environment for both minds and hearts.

Our vision of ***Collaborative Innovators***, ***Compassionate Leaders*** continues to guide all that we do. We are committed to developing young individuals who are not only equipped with knowledge and skills but who also embody empathy and a sense of purpose in serving others.

Through our mission of ***Growing Minds***, ***Glowing Hearts,*** we foster confident, self-directed learners with the courage to embrace challenges and the resilience to adapt in an ever-changing world. We also place great emphasis on building character and values, nurturing students who will thrive both in school and beyond.

Edgefield is a place where every child is valued and supported to develop their fullest potential. This is made possible through the dedication of our caring teachers, the encouragement of families, and the strength of our partnerships with the community. Together, we create a safe and nurturing environment where students can discover their passions, grow their strengths, and contribute meaningfully to society.

I warmly invite all parents and partners to continue this meaningful journey with us. With your trust and support, we will empower every Edgefielder to become a Collaborative Innovator and Compassionate Leader.

Mr Simon Foo<br>
Principal<br>
