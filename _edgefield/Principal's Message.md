Welcome back to school!  

  

With the start of 2022, we also warmly welcome our Secondary 1 students!  

  

2021 has continued to be an extraordinary year for all of us. Let us look ahead with anticipation at 2022 as we continue to navigate the changes ahead of us. Our ability to remain flexible and adaptable certainly prepares us to be future ready and able to cope with new challenges that come our way. 

From nurturing Resolute and Compassionate Role Models to Collaborative Innovators, Compassionate Leaders, these past 10 years of Edgefield Secondary School has been a journey where the dreams of teachers, students, parents and partners have been forged and realized, a journey that consistently build upon successes of those before, to scale new peaks of excellence in the present in order to bring about benefits to those after. The Pay-It-Forward belief continues to undergird the DNA of an Edgefielder, as we seek to equip every student with future ready dispositions, competencies, and skills to surmount the complex challenges in the VUCA world. 

That is where we have put in place a Future Ready Total Curriculum comprising various quality programmes designed based on established research to provide unique and meaningful learning experiences for our students. These ranges from fostering innovation, entrepreneurship and future readiness through our Applied Learning Programme - Growing the Edgefield Mindset, developing values such as respect and resilience through our Learning for Life Programme - Character Education through Sports anchored on Taekwondo, to encouraging Student Voice, Agency and Advocacy for social causes through our Compassionate Leaders in Action. 

We have also reshaped the psychosocial environment through Full Subject-Based Banding to benefit students’ social, emotional and cognitive growth. We harnessed the affordances of technology through our Personalised Digital Learning Programme and Blended Learning, to nurture our students to be autonomous learners, allowing for more self-directed and collaborative learning, even during the pandemic. 

As Socrates says “Wisdom begins with Wonder”. Every single detail in our programmes didn’t come about by chance, but has been lovingly designed to meet the immediate and future needs of our Edgefielder. At Edgefield, we are committed to providing our students with a vibrant school life and stimulating educational experiences that will spark their curiosity and ignite a passion for life-long learning. 

Our gratitude goes to our School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group, Alumni, parents, our various partners, teachers and staff, for journeying these significant 10 years with us. As a school community, we collaborated and supported each other to our very best, all for the good of our children. These 10 years would not have been possible without all their support. 

Celebrating a decade of excellence and wishing all a good year of learning ahead! 

Mr Lee Peck Ping  
Principal
