Established in 2011, Edgefield Secondary School has embarked on an inspiring journey of
growth and development in its commitment to providing a holistic education to its students.
Under the dedicated leadership of Mr. Lee Peck Ping, who served as the principal from 2017 to
2023, the school has consistently striven to deliver exceptional learning experiences tailored to
meet the diverse needs of every Edgefield student. We express our heartfelt appreciation to
Mr. Lee for his invaluable contributions and extend our warmest wishes for his continued
success in his future endeavors.<br><br>
I am truly honoured to have been entrusted with the stewardship of Edgefield Secondary
School, a dynamic institution with an unwavering focus on preparing students for a rapidly
evolving future. It is a privilege to build upon the legacy established by those who have
wholeheartedly dedicated themselves to the school's growth.<br><br>
Our vision "**Collaborative Innovators, Compassionate Leaders**" epitomises our commitment to
nurturing students who are not only well-equipped with the skills and knowledge needed for
future success but are also driven by compassion and empathy as they serve Singapore. Our
mission "**Growing Minds, Glowing Hearts**" reflects our deep-seated ethos of developing self-
directed learners who can adapt effectively to changing conditions. At Edgefield, we place a
strong emphasis on cultivating Social-Emotional (SE) skills, which are vital for students' success
in developing positive learning dispositions that will enable them to continually adapt and
thrive in the future.<br><br>
In our relentless pursuit of excellence, Edgefield will continue to leverage innovative pedagogy
and digital technology to enhance learning. However, we understand that we cannot walk this
path alone. We wholeheartedly invite our valued parents, partners, and stakeholders to join us
in shaping the future of Edgefield Secondary School. Together, we will empower our students
with the skills and values they need to become Future Ready Thinkers and Compassionate
Leaders who are prepared to embrace the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow.

Mr Simon Foo<br>
Principal<br>
Edgefield Secondary School
