* Future Ready Programme nurtures creative and collaborative complex problem solving skills through a scenario-based approach.Â  
* Growing an Entrepreneurial Mindset (G.E.M) (Applied Learning Programme, ALP) inculcates entrepreneurial skills such as thinking-out-of-the-box and developing an alertness to opportunities.
* Character development through sports, anchored on Taekwondo (Learning for Life Programme, LLP) develops self-defence skills alongside values such as respect and resilience.
